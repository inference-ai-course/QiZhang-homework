Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.
Do They Understand Them? An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs' pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy. However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future inclusive AI research.
ITUNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 8: Question-Answering over Tabular Data: A Zero-Shot Approach using LLM-Driven Code Generation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper presents our system for Task 8: DataBench, over Tabular Data. The primary objective of this task is to perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains under two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solution with a particular emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation. Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pandas code via optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs exhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation. Additionally, results show that code generation achieves superior performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches. Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this paper's submission, our system achieved eighth place in Subtask I and sixth place in Subtask~II among the 30 systems that outperformed the baseline in the open-source models category.
MMBERT: Scaled Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal BERT for Robust Chinese Hate Speech Detection under Cloaking Perturbations View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing in-context learning approaches.
GLiDRE: Generalist Lightweight model for Document-level Relation Extraction View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing, and its document-level variant poses significant challenges, due to the need to model complex interactions between entities across sentences. Current approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly evaluated on benchmarks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. However, their performance in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored to the task's complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar motivation, we introduce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against state-of-the-art models across various data settings on the Re-DocRED dataset. Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available.
Agentic large language models improve retrieval-based radiology question answering View PDFAbstract:Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P 200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g., MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.

Out-of-Context Abduction: LLMs Make Inferences About Procedural Data Leveraging Declarative Facts in Earlier Training Data View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear whether they can reason about the information present within their training data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using relevant facts present in data. We train treatment LLMs on names and behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.
Dynamically Adaptive Reasoning via LLM-Guided MCTS for Efficient and Context-Aware KGQA View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
NyayaRAG: Realistic Legal Judgment Prediction with RAG under the Indian Common Law System View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law, aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.
Classification of Psychiatry Clinical Notes by Diagnosis: A Deep Learning and Machine Learning Approach View PDFAbstract:The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the performance of various Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT and SciBERT), to classify notes into these two diagnoses. Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling, Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling techniques had minimal on model performance overall. The only exception was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models. However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The Decision Tree eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model performance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted diagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of different model architectures and data balancing methods.
Better Call Claude: Can LLMs Detect Changes of Writing Style? View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This article explores the zero-shot performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on one of the most challenging tasks in authorship analysis: sentence-level style change detection. Benchmarking four LLMs on the official PAN~2024 and 2025 "Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis" datasets, we present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are sensitive to variations in writing style - even at the granular level of individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline for the task, outperforming suggested baselines of the PAN competition. Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously reported.
Segment First, Retrieve Better: Realistic Legal Search via Rhetorical Role-Based Queries View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking. Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets, TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is available.
Team "better_call_claude": Style Change Detection using a Sequential Sentence Pair Classifier View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Style change detection - identifying the points in a document where writing style shifts - remains one of the most important and challenging problems in computational authorship analysis. At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level: individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that is, a series of sentences - as a whole, Pair Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model (PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document. The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most challenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of "stylistically shallow", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed benchmark data. Evaluated on the official PAN-2025 test datasets, the model achieves strong macro-F1 scores of 0.923, 0.828, and 0.724 on the EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD data, respectively, outperforming not only the official random baselines but also a much more challenging one: claude-3.7-sonnet's zero-shot performance.
MELAC: Massive Evaluation of Large Language Models with Alignment of Culture in Persian Language View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in our daily lives, evaluating their quality and reliability across diverse contexts has become essential. While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law, Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.
Medical Reasoning in the Era of LLMs: A Systematic Review of Enhancement Techniques and Applications View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.
Demo: TOSense -- What Did You Just Agree to? View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Online services often require users to agree to lengthy and obscure Terms of Service (ToS), leading to information asymmetry and legal risks. This paper proposes TOSense-a Chrome extension that allows users to ask questions about ToS in natural language and get concise answers in real time. The system combines (i) a crawler "tos-crawl" that automatically extracts ToS content, and (ii) a lightweight large language model pipeline: MiniLM for semantic retrieval and BART-encoder for answer relevance verification. To avoid expensive manual annotation, we present a novel Question Answering Evaluation Pipeline (QEP) that generates synthetic questions and verifies the correctness of answers using clustered topic matching. Experiments on five major platforms, Apple, Google, X (formerly Twitter), Microsoft, and Netflix, show the effectiveness of TOSense (with up to 44.5% accuracy) across varying number of topic clusters. During the demonstration, we will showcase TOSense in action. Attendees will be able to experience seamless extraction, interactive question answering, and instant indexing of new sites.
DACTYL: Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we introduce the Yielded from Language models (DACTYL), a challenging text detection dataset focusing on one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE) optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by 50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG text detectors.
Prompting Science Report 3: I'll pay you or I'll kill you -- but will you care? View PDFAbstract:This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business, education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025, 8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).
GHTM: A Graph based Hybrid Topic Modeling Approach in Low-Resource Bengali Language View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that is used to identify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to its morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called GHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce semantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model by outperforming other models in topic coherence and diversity. In addition, we introduce a novel Bengali dataset called "NCTBText" sourced from Bengali textbook materials to enrich and diversify the predominantly newspaper-centric Bengali corpora.
A Context-Aware Dual-Metric Framework for Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications. Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided. To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics. First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second, unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through the global consistency of the generated answers without context. Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness, achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.
Context-based Motion Retrieval using Open Vocabulary Methods for Autonomous Driving View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language. Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval, when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.
SynAdapt: Learning Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models via Synthetic Continuous Chain-of-Thought View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT). Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically, \textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this, \textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off.
Activation-Guided Local Editing for Jailbreaking Attacks View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Jailbreaking is an essential adversarial technique for red-teaming these models to uncover and patch security flaws. However, existing jailbreak methods face significant drawbacks. Token-level jailbreak attacks often produce incoherent or unreadable inputs and exhibit poor transferability, while prompt-level attacks lack scalability and rely heavily on manual effort and human ingenuity. We propose a concise and effective two-stage framework that combines the advantages of these approaches. The first stage performs a scenario-based generation of context and rephrases the original malicious query to obscure its harmful intent. The second stage then utilizes information from the model's hidden states to guide fine-grained edits, effectively steering the model's internal representation of the input from a malicious toward a benign one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method achieves state-of-the-art Attack Success Rate, with gains of up to 37.74% over the strongest baseline, and exhibits excellent transferability to black-box models. Our analysis further demonstrates that AGILE maintains substantial effectiveness against prominent defense mechanisms, highlighting the limitations of current safeguards and providing valuable insights for future defense development.

ContestTrade: A Multi-Agent Trading System Based on Internal Contest Mechanism View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In financial trading, large language model (LLM)-based agents demonstrate significant potential. However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multiagent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.
PaPaformer: Language Model from Pre-trained Paraller Paths View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks. We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model. The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model. This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to accommodate specific task requirements.
The Prosody of Emojis View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Prosodic features such as pitch, timing, and intonation are central to spoken communication, conveying emotion, intent, and discourse structure. In text-based settings, where these cues are absent, emojis act as visual surrogates that add affective and pragmatic nuance. This study examines how emojis influence prosodic realisation in speech and how listeners interpret prosodic cues to recover emoji meanings. Unlike previous work, we directly link prosody and emoji by analysing actual human speech data, collected through structured but open-ended production and perception tasks. This provides empirical evidence of how emoji semantics shape spoken delivery and perception. Results show that speakers adapt their prosody based on emoji cues, listeners can often identify the intended emoji from prosodic variation alone, and greater semantic differences between emojis correspond to increased prosodic divergence. These findings suggest that emojis can act as meaningful carriers of prosodic intent, offering insight into their communicative role in digitally mediated contexts.
Towards a unified framework for programming paradigms: A systematic review of classification formalisms and methodological foundations View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The rise of multi-paradigm languages challenges traditional classification methods, leading to practical software engineering issues like interoperability defects. This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of programming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the art formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the conceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful, reconstructive approach.
EFlat-LoRA: Efficiently Seeking Flat Minima for Better Generalization in Fine-Tuning Large Language Models and Beyond View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Little research explores the correlation between the expressive ability and generalization ability of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to flat minima for LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across multiple matrices in low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and 0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets, respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Grounding on Egocentric Videos View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored, despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask, the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-, medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets. Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at this https URL .
The Missing Parts: Augmenting Fact Verification with Half-Truth Detection View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Fact verification systems typically assess whether a claim is supported by retrieved evidence, assuming that truthfulness depends solely on what is stated. However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet misleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle with such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid. We introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a new benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence alignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present TRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based misinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating the causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing fact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple strong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16 points, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact verification.
GETALP@AutoMin 2025: Leveraging RAG to Answer Questions based on Meeting Transcripts View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper documents GETALP's submission to the Third Run of the Automatic Minuting Shared Task at SIGDial 2025. We participated in Task B: question-answering based on meeting transcripts. Our method is based on a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system and Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR). We propose three systems combining these two approaches. Our results show that incorporating AMR leads to high-quality responses for approximately 35% of the questions and provides notable improvements in answering questions that involve distinguishing between different participants (e.g., who questions).
Learning an Efficient Multi-Turn Dialogue Evaluator from Multiple Judges View PDFAbstract:Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the ``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.
ReaGAN: Node-as-Agent-Reasoning Graph Agentic Network View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.
Combining Discrete Wavelet and Cosine Transforms for Efficient Sentence Embedding View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Wavelets have emerged as a cutting edge technology in a number of fields. Concrete results of their application in Image and Signal processing suggest that wavelets can be effectively applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks that capture a variety of linguistic properties. In this paper, we leverage the power of applying Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We first evaluate, intrinsically and extrinsically, how wavelets can effectively be used to consolidate important information in a word vector while reducing its dimensionality. We further combine DWT with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to propose a non-parameterized model that compresses a sentence with a dense amount of in a fixed size vector based on locally varying word features. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm on downstream applications models yielding comparable and even superior (in some tasks) results to original embeddings.
Cognitive Kernel-Pro: A Framework for Deep Research Agents and Agent Foundation Models Training View PDFAbstract:General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the research community. In this work, we present \textbf{Cognitive Kernel-Pro}, a fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our 8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for accessible, high-capability AI agents.

Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating unit test generation, significantly reducing the manual effort required by developers. To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it is crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects real-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test generation benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination and structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the validity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these limited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to contamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural simplicity.
SA-GCS: Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling for UAV Vision-Language Navigation View PDFAbstract:Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence, and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Curriculum Scheduling (SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator (SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution, enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.
Multi-Layer Attention is the Amplifier of Demonstration Effectiveness View PDFAbstract:Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context learning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However, existing work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations provided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations are effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration ineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear self-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a demonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by the model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is amplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective ones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus on the relevance the user query while overlooking the information that the model has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which leverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as the criterion, thereby ensuring of the chosen ones. We validate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream datasets. The experimental results confirm that demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating our derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\%$ on average over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.
EdgeInfinite-Instruct: Bridging SFT-Based Optimization and NPU-Level Efficiency for Edge Devices View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.
Lucy: edgerunning agentic web search on mobile with machine generated task vectors View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Small language models (SLMs) are inherently limited in knowledge-intensive tasks due to their constrained capacity. While test-time computation offers a path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's internal reasoning, delimited by and tags, as a dynamic task vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on the fly. We developed a method to optimize this task vector machine through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured, self-constructed task reasoning.
PilotRL: Training Language Model Agents via Global Planning-Guided Progressive Reinforcement Learning View PDFAbstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks. Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78% comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.
Improving Multimodal Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings with Object-Phrase Alignment View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Multimodal sentence embedding models typically leverage image-caption pairs in addition to textual data during training. However, such pairs often contain noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal representation learning.
R1-ACT: Efficient Reasoning Model Safety Alignment by Activating Safety Knowledge View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90 minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and practical efficiency of our approach.
Systematic Evaluation of Optimization Techniques for Long-Context Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations, characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the scalability of optimization methods on a larger variant with 70 billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts. Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.
Integrating clinical reasoning into large language model-based diagnosis through etiology-aware attention steering View PDFAbstract:Objective: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities in medical text understanding and generation. However, their diagnostic reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems complex clinical settings.
Mind the Gap: The Divergence Between Human and LLM-Generated Tasks View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent (GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied this http URL conclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of more human-aligned agents.
MetaAgent: Toward Self-Evolving Agent via Tool Meta-Learning View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts. Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual, data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp, MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our source codes in this https URL.
Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and moral beliefs.
Towards Higher Effective Rank in Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning using Khatri--Rao Product View PDFAbstract:Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties. Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks. To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large language up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune billion-scale parameter models.
RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves capability boundary collapse problem.
Semantic Compression for Word and Sentence Embeddings using Discrete Wavelet Transform View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Wavelet transforms, a powerful mathematical tool, have been widely used in different domains, including Signal and Image processing, to unravel intricate patterns, enhance data representation, and extract meaningful features from data. Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by 50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks, while achieving superior accuracy in most tasks. Our findings pave the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.
Tabular Data Understanding with LLMs: A Survey of Recent Advances and Challenges View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex, multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks, instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different tabular representations and formats.
Comparison of Large Language Models for Deployment Requirements View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) are revolutionizing the generation of human-like text, producing contextually relevant and syntactically correct content. Despite challenges like biases and hallucinations, these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models excel in tasks, such as content creation, translation, and code generation. Fine-tuning and novel architectures, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), address these issues. Over the past two years, numerous open-source foundational and fine-tuned models have been introduced, complicating the selection of the optimal LLM for researchers and companies regarding licensing and hardware requirements. To navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape and facilitate LLM selection, we present a comparative list of foundational and domain-specific models, focusing on features, such as release year, licensing, hardware requirements. This list is published on GitLab and will be continuously updated.
On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray) and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings, we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.
Watch the Weights: Unsupervised monitoring and control of fine-tuned LLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.
Is neural semantic parsing good at ellipsis resolution, or isn't it? View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Neural semantic parsers have shown good overall performance for a variety of linguistic phenomena, reaching semantic matching scores of more than 90%. But how do such parsers perform on strongly context-sensitive phenomena, where large pieces of semantic information need to be duplicated to form a meaningful semantic representation? A case in point is English verb phrase ellipsis, a construct where entire verb phrases can be abbreviated by a single auxiliary verb. Are the otherwise known as powerful semantic parsers able to deal with ellipsis or aren't they? We constructed a corpus of 120 cases of ellipsis with their fully resolved meaning representation and used this as a challenge set for a large battery of neural semantic parsers. Although these parsers performed very well on the standard test set, they failed in the instances with ellipsis. Data augmentation
FACTORY: A Challenging Human-Verified Prompt Set for Long-Form Factuality View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set. Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed facts.
Semiotic Complexity and Its Epistemological Implications for Modeling Culture View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for epistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the field. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation work from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical domain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of their translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work -- to ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation errors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this paper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of theorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling practices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic complexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across interpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices -- especially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating semiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems epistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out several recommendations for researchers to better account for these epistemological issues in their own work.
Do LLMs produce texts with "human-like" lexical diversity? View PDFAbstract:The degree to which LLMs produce writing that is truly human-like remains unclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has received. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini, and -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n = 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions lexical diversity were measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness, disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and Support Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini and -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated higher levels lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education, language status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce less human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these results for language pedagogy and related applications.
A Survey on Code Generation with LLM-based Agents View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.
PhysicsEval: Inference-Time Techniques to Improve the Reasoning Proficiency of Large Language Models on Physics Problems View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and educational websites. Our code and data are publicly available at this https URL.
Cascaded Information Disclosure for Generalized Evaluation of Problem Solving Capabilities View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families. Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in standard QA evaluation settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.
SimuRA: Towards General Goal-Oriented Agent via Simulative Reasoning Architecture with LLM-Based World Model View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing.
CoT-Self-Instruct: Building high-quality synthetic prompts for reasoning and non-reasoning tasks View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard.
Rule2Text: Natural Language Explanation of Logical Rules in Knowledge Graphs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules. Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets, FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and also assess the use language models as automatic judges. Our results demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and clarity, although several challenges remain for future research.

Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving View PDFAbstract:LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning.
TextQuests: How Good are LLMs at Text-Based Video Games? View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at this https URL.
TweakLLM: A Routing Architecture for Dynamic Tailoring of Cached Responses View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.
Arabic Hate Speech Identification and Masking in Social Media using Deep Learning Models and Pre-trained Models Fine-tuning View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1) to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the dirty text. The presented methods achieve model in hate speech detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached 0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state of the art machine translation systems.
Deep Learning-based Prediction of Clinical Trial Enrollment with Uncertainty Estimates View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into expressive representations. These representations are then combined with encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration, assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline models.
DiffLoRA: Differential Low-Rank Adapters for Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks, including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this behavior.
T-Detect: Tail-Aware Statistical Normalization for Robust Detection of Adversarial Machine-Generated Text View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the development of robust detection methods capable of identifying machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution, providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at this https URL.
Med-R$^3$: Enhancing Medical Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs via Progressive Reinforcement Learning View PDFAbstract:In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.
MECAT: A Multi-Experts Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs. The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at this https URL
A Novel Evaluation Benchmark for Medical LLMs: Illuminating Safety and Effectiveness in Clinical Domains View PDFAbstract:Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30 criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures. Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%), with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001). Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs, facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in healthcare environments.
Role-Aware Language Models for Secure and Contextualized Access Control in Organizations View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic, role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.
Counterfactual Evaluation for Blind Attack Detection in LLM-based Evaluation Systems View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer. An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.
Beyond Passive Critical Thinking: Fostering Proactive Questioning to Enhance Human-AI Collaboration View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions. Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and inference-time scaling, they struggle with critical thinking, especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm, we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to 73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.
Enhanced Arabic Text Retrieval with Attentive Relevance Scoring View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects. Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At the core of our approach is a novel Relevance Scoring (ARS) that replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages. Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available at \href{this https URL}{GitHub}.
MRGSEM-Sum: An Unsupervised Multi-document Summarization Framework based on Multi-Relational Graphs and Structural Entropy Minimization View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the complex among documents using graph structures and reduces information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News, DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.
Beyond the Cloud: Assessing the Benefits and Drawbacks of Local LLM Deployment for Translators View PDFAbstract:The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of individual translators and small businesses.
Causal2Vec: Improving Decoder-only LLMs as Versatile Embedding Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks. However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining. Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs without altering their original architectures or introducing significant computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture contextualized information even without attending to future tokens. Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and help LLMs better leverage semantic information encoded in the Contextual token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time up to 82% compared to best-performing methods.
MPCC: A Novel Benchmark for Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints in Multimodal Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.
Holistic Evaluations of Topic Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Topic models are gaining increasing commercial and academic interest for their ability to summarize large volumes of unstructured text. As unsupervised machine learning methods, they enable researchers to explore data and help general users understand key themes in large text collections. However, they risk becoming a 'black box', where users input data and accept the output as an accurate summary without scrutiny. This article evaluates topic models from a database perspective, drawing insights from 1140 BERTopic model runs. The goal is to identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters and to reflect on what these findings mean for the interpretation and responsible use of topic models
SWE-Exp: Experience-Driven Software Issue Resolution View PDFAbstract:Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts. Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes. Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6% Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue resolution.
Text-to-SQL Task-oriented Dialogue Ontology Construction View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.
SWE-Debate: Competitive Multi-Agent Debate for Software Issue Resolution View PDFAbstract:Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks. While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and outperforms baselines by a large margin.
DSBC : Data Science task Benchmarking with Context engineering View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect real-world user interactions with science agents by observing usage of our commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with context engineering, multi-step context engineering, and with SmolAgent. Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies, highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.
MUST-RAG: MUSical Text Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.
What's Taboo for You? - An Empirical Evaluation of LLMs Behavior Toward Sensitive Content View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts. Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against traditional methods.
SequenceLayers: Sequence Processing and Streaming Neural Networks Made Easy View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling, designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g., autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation. This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers (JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at this https URL.
Unveiling Super Experts in Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs. However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g., pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii) We further enhance our of the influence of SEs compression. Our findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are crucial for distribution of attention scores but are significantly disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at this https URL.
Evaluating LLMs' Multilingual Capabilities for Bengali: Benchmark Creation and Performance Analysis View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient \& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language technologies worldwide.

P-ReMIS: Pragmatic Reasoning in Mental Health and a Social Implication View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored previously mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to the other two LLMs.
Generalized Reinforcement Learning for Retriever-Specific Query Rewriter with Unstructured Real-World Documents View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse, unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce \textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house data demonstrate significant improvements, with $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3 for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable, annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.
Enabling Few-Shot Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Tabular Biomarker Data with LLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.
Model Directions, Not Words: Mechanistic Topic Models Using Sparse Autoencoders View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate complex topics. We introduce Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover, uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.
Failures Are the Stepping Stones to Success: Enhancing Few-Shot In-Context Learning by Leveraging Negative Samples View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
Geak: Introducing Triton Kernel AI Agent & Evaluation Benchmarks View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia. As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs, aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of GEAK-like agentic generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.
LENS: Learning Ensemble Confidence from Neural States for Multi-LLM Answer Integration View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.
User Feedback in Human-LLM Dialogues: A Lens to Understand Users But Noisy as a Learning Signal View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze feedback in the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such feedback occurs. Second, study harvesting learning signals from such implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench). We also that the usefulness user feedback is largely tied to the quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.
ISO-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Causal Reasoning in Visual-Language Models through Procedural Plans View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal models.
Uncovering the Fragility of Trustworthy LLMs through Chinese Textual Ambiguity View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs, representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans. Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub repository: this https URL.
RASL: Retrieval Augmented Schema Linking for Massive Database Text-to-SQL View PDFAbstract:Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget. Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy, with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database interfaces.
SMART-Editor: A Multi-Agent Framework for Human-Like Design Editing with Structural Integrity View PDFAbstract:We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images) domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain, cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images. Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.
Context-aware Rotary Position Embedding View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures, enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms. Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally, CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability. These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer models.
Exploring In-Context Learning for Frame-Semantic Parsing View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1 scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for domain-specific FSP tasks.
Math Natural Language Inference: this should be easy! View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem. We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field. We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs. We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to using human-labeled data in Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings, we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.
Where to show Demos in Your Prompt: A Positional Bias of In-Context Learning View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time: we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks. We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position. Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN, LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast, at the end of user message flips over 30\% of predictions without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on complex tasks.
C3: A Bilingual Benchmark for Spoken Dialogue Models Exploring Challenges in Complex Conversations View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns. Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079 instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these practical challenges.
RecGPT Technical Report View PDFAbstract:Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants, and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e., optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent. This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem.
GeoOutageKG: A Multimodal Geospatiotemporal Knowledge Graph for Multiresolution Power Outage Analysis View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year, exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image data provides significantly higher resolution and enables a more comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events. However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology, GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from 2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power outages.
The Incomplete Bridge: How AI Research (Mis)Engages with Psychology View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Social sciences have accumulated a rich body of theories and methodologies for investigating the human mind and behaviors, while offering valuable insights into the design and understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Focusing on psychology as a prominent case, this study explores the interdisciplinary synergy between AI and the field by analyzing 1,006 LLM-related papers published in premier AI venues between 2023 and 2025, along with the 2,544 psychology publications they cite. Through our analysis, we identify key patterns of interdisciplinary integration, locate the psychology domains most frequently referenced, and highlight areas that remain underexplored. We further examine how psychology theories/frameworks are operationalized and interpreted, identify common types of misapplication, and offer guidance for more effective incorporation. Our work provides a comprehensive map of interdisciplinary engagement AI and psychology, thereby facilitating deeper collaboration and advancing AI systems.
Beyond Natural Language Plans: Structure-Aware Planning for Query-Focused Table Summarization View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.
DBLPLink 2.0 -- An Entity Linker for the DBLP Scholarly Knowledge Graph View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this work we present an entity linker for DBLP's 2025 version of RDF-based Knowledge Graph. Compared to the 2022 version, DBLP now considers publication venues as a new entity type called dblp:Stream. In the earlier version of DBLPLink, we trained KG-embeddings and re-rankers on a dataset to produce entity linkings. In contrast, in this work, we develop a zero-shot entity linker using LLMs using a novel method, where we re-rank candidate entities based on the log-probabilities of the "yes" token output at the penultimate layer of the LLM.
MASCA: LLM based-Multi Agents System for Credit Assessment View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling. However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions. Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment, addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit scoring.
Opportunities and Challenges of LLMs in Education: An NLP Perspective View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Interest in the role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, considering the new opportunities they offer for teaching, learning, and assessment. In this paper, we examine the impact of LLMs on educational NLP in the context of two main application scenarios: {\em assistance} and {\em assessment}, grounding them along the four dimensions -- reading, writing, speaking, and tutoring. We then present the new directions enabled by LLMs, and the key challenges to address. We envision that this holistic overview would be useful for NLP researchers and practitioners interested in exploring role LLMs in developing language-focused and NLP-enabled educational applications of the future.
CUS-QA: Local-Knowledge-Oriented Open-Ended Question Answering Dataset View PDFAbstract:We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia, created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover, apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for open-ended question answering.
Next Tokens Denoising for Speech Synthesis View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens per second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and utilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model highly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.
Reducing Hallucinations in Summarization via Reinforcement Learning with Entity Hallucination Index View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly optimizes for Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline, facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.
Resource-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Text Embeddings via Prompt Engineering and Contrastive Fine-tuning View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However, pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information. Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering, classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and (iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically generated positive pairs.
Investigating Hallucination in Conversations for Low Resource Languages View PDFAbstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as 'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.
From Sufficiency to Reflection: Reinforcement-Guided Thinking Quality in Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for LLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality. This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data are available at: this https URL.
Listening to the Unspoken: Exploring 365 Aspects of Multimodal Interview Performance Assessment View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates' suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores ``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three} modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and \textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview performance assessment. The full implementation is available at this https URL.
GPT-4.1 Sets the Standard in Automated Experiment Design Using Novel Python Libraries View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly as tools for automating code generation in scientific research, yet their ability to interpret and use unfamiliar Python APIs for complex computational experiments remains poorly characterized. This study systematically benchmarks a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating functional Python code for two increasingly challenging scenarios: conversational data analysis with the \textit{ParShift} library, and synthetic data generation and clustering using \textit{pyclugen} and \textit{scikit-learn}. Both experiments use structured, zero-shot prompts specifying detailed requirements but omitting in-context examples. Model outputs are evaluated quantitatively for functional correctness and prompt compliance over multiple runs, and qualitatively by analyzing the errors produced when code execution fails. Results show that only a small subset of models consistently generate correct, executable code, with GPT-4.1 standing out as the only model to always succeed in both tasks. In addition to benchmarking LLM performance, this approach helps identify shortcomings in third-party libraries, such as unclear documentation or obscure implementation bugs. Overall, these findings highlight current limitations of LLMs for end-to-end scientific automation and emphasize the need for careful prompt design, comprehensive library documentation, and continued advances in language model capabilities.
Multilingual Political Views of Large Language Models: Identification and Steering View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings. Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
Language Arithmetics: Towards Systematic Language Neuron Identification and Manipulation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of linguistic proximity.
VL-Cogito: Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Multimodal Reasoning View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model trained via a novel multi-stage Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.
BALSAM: A Platform for Benchmarking Arabic Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The impressive advancement of Language Models (LLMs) in English has not been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps. In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.
Unveiling the Influence of Amplifying Language-Specific Neurons View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them. However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge (Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.
Efficient Differentially Private Fine-Tuning of LLMs via Reinforcement Learning View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise, degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.
Exploiting Synergistic Cognitive Biases to Bypass Safety in LLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models. CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety, paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.
ControlMed: Adding Reasoning Control to Medical Language Model View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support. Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2) supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.
Pre-trained Models Perform the Best When Token Distributions Follow Zipf's Law View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.
A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation Framework for Vietnamese Large Language Models in Customer Support View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Language Models (LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However, domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios. We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11 lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly available at this https URL.
CliCARE: Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health Records View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex, longitudinal cancer Health Records (EHRs). However, their implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we propose CliCARE, a framework for Electronic Health Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph. This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation. We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol, which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert oncologists.
SLM-SQL: An Exploration of Small Language Models for Text-to-SQL View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy (EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset, model, and code to github: this https URL.
Exploring Dynamic Parameters for Vietnamese Gender-Independent ASR View PDFAbstract:The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture the characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation. These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender independence than the baseline MFCCs.
IFEvalCode: Controlled Code Generation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code; however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints, beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics: correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus code that precisely follows instructions.
What is an "Abstract Reasoner"? Revisiting Experiments and Arguments about Large Language Models Title:What Language Models
Falcon-H1: A Family of Hybrid-Head Language Models Redefining Efficiency and Performance View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models (LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1 is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024. These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks, instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license, underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.
AI-generated stories favour stability over change: homogeneity and cultural stereotyping in narratives generated by gpt-4o-mini View PDFAbstract:Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated 11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a 1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events. Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.
NeedleChain: Measuring Intact Long-Context Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance. Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code and datasets are available at this https URL
Question Generation for Assessing Early Literacy Reading Comprehension View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Assessment of reading comprehension through content-based interactions plays an important role in the reading acquisition process. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating comprehension questions geared to K-2 English learners. Our method ensures complete coverage of the underlying material and adaptation to the learner's specific proficiencies, and can generate a large diversity of question types at various difficulty levels to ensure a thorough evaluation. We evaluate the performance of various language models in this framework using the FairytaleQA dataset as the source material. Eventually, the proposed approach has the potential to become an important part of autonomous AI-driven English instructors.
PATENTWRITER: A Benchmarking Study for Patent Drafting with LLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations, and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks. We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone. Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and future research.
Traits Run Deep: Enhancing Personality Assessment via Psychology-Guided LLM Representations and Multimodal Apparent Behaviors View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called \textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs \textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a \textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality. Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e., approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority, ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made available at this https URL.
LLM-Crowdsourced: A Benchmark-Free Paradigm for Mutual Evaluation of Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task. Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination, black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm, LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently, and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria: dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit ''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high consistency (robustness).
Scalable Spectrum Availability Prediction using a Markov Chain Framework and ITU-R Propagation Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Spectrum resources are often underutilized across time and space, motivating dynamic spectrum access strategies that allow secondary users to exploit unused frequencies. A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be available (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive and interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for spectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model of primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R (specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss and clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference thresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the proposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with improved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach, analyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions, limitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be adapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show that the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in cognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems.
A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Negation for NLP and Neural Retrievers View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions; (2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance of information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based classification mechanism used to analyze performance of retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.
Intent Recognition and Out-of-Scope Detection using LLMs in Multi-party Conversations View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However, traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system performance improvement.
Meaning-infused grammar: Gradient Acceptability Shapes the Geometric Representations of Constructions in LLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience. We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions (Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of $5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.
CoEx -- Co-evolving World-model and Exploration View PDFAbstract:Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld, PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent paradigms in planning and exploration.
RL from Teacher-Model Refinement: Gradual Imitation Learning for Machine Translation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance, promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher, mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement. On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy) and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.
How Well Does First-Token Entropy Approximate Word Entropy as a Psycholinguistic Predictor? View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC) estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens. Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using first-token approximations of contextual entropy.
The role of media memorability in facilitating startups' access to venture capital funding View PDFAbstract:Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept media memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.
Explainability Through Systematicity: The Hard Systematicity Challenge for Artificial Intelligence View PDFAbstract:This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI). Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the "systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed "the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking about systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between systematicity and connectionism and show that the of systematicity that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational, authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization and explore what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be regulated by rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic we need models to be and when.
A Scalable Pipeline for Estimating Verb Frame Frequencies Using Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We present an automated pipeline for estimating Frame Frequencies (VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames. VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale, accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and release all code and data to support future research.
Persona-Augmented Benchmarking: Evaluating LLMs Across Diverse Writing Styles View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs, which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation. Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.
Strategic Deflection: Defending LLMs from Logit Manipulation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas, ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced threats.
IndoPref: A Multi-Domain Pairwise Preference Dataset for Indonesian View PDFAbstract:Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement. Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the output quality of each model.
Prompt Optimization and Evaluation for LLM Automated Red Teaming View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming widespread, making the identification of system vulnerabilities increasingly important. Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization, ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.
Meta CLIP 2: A Worldwide Scaling Recipe View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model, supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present Meta CLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, Meta CLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.
DeepSieve: Information Sieving via LLM-as-a-Knowledge-Router View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity, transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability over conventional RAG approaches. Our codes are available at this https URL.
UserBench: An Interactive Gym Environment for User-Centric Agents View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive environment to measure and advance this critical capability.
UI-AGILE: Advancing GUI Agents with Effective Reinforcement Learning and Precise Inference-Time Grounding View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.
Predicting Microbial Ontology and Pathogen Risk from Environmental Metadata with Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli, using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.
Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.
Post-Training Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization, similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally curated rewards.
Training language models to be warm and empathetic makes them less reliable and more sycophantic View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language models with and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and social interaction.
Rote Learning Considered Useful: Generalizing over Memorized Data in LLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8 LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured, semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.
Who's important? -- SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for Timeline Generation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online, tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present Time for the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Language Models (LLMs) to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations. Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within news article.
Graph-R1: Towards Agentic GraphRAG Framework via End-to-end Reinforcement Learning View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost, fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.
AutoTIR: Autonomous Tools Integrated Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid, predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence. Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness, structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at this https URL.
Introducing HALC: A general pipeline for finding optimal prompting strategies for automated coding with LLMs in the computational social sciences Title:Introducing social sciences
Modelling Adjectival Modification Effects on Semantic Plausibility View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event modification. Understanding in plausibility is relevant for tasks such as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment the task - even under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic, balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.
HRIPBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Harm Reduction Information Provision to Support People Who Use Drugs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to PWUD. The use of LLMs harm reduction contexts should be cautiously constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.
Overview of ADoBo at IberLEF 2025: Automatic Detection of Anglicisms in Spanish View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper summarizes the main findings of ADoBo 2025, the shared task on anglicism identification in Spanish proposed in the context of IberLEF 2025. Participants of ADoBo 2025 were asked to detect English lexical borrowings (or anglicisms) from a collection of Spanish journalistic texts. Five teams submitted their solutions for the test phase. Proposed systems included LLMs, deep learning models, Transformer-based models and rule-based systems. The results range from F1 scores of 0.17 to 0.99, which showcases the variability in performance different systems can have for this task.
ChartMark: A Structured Grammar for Chart Annotation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Chart annotations enhance visualization accessibility but suffer from fragmented, non-standardized representations that limit cross-platform reuse. We propose ChartMark, a structured grammar that separates annotation semantics from visualization implementations. ChartMark features a hierarchical framework mapping onto annotation dimensions (e.g., task, chart context), supporting both abstract intents and precise visual details. Our toolkit demonstrates converting ChartMark specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations, highlighting its flexibility, expressiveness, and practical applicability.
The Problem with Safety Classification is not just the Models View PDFAbstract:Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue. Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves, there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual disparities exist in 5 classification models by considering datasets covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.
AgriEval: A Comprehensive Chinese Agricultural Benchmark for Large Language Models View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29 subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios: memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data. The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments, providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167 open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy, underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at this https URL.
Adversarial Defence without Adversarial Defence: Enhancing Language Model Robustness via Instance-level Principal Component Removal View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.
UnsafeChain: Enhancing Reasoning Model Safety via Hard Cases View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs. To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and code at this https URL
Libra: Assessing and Improving Reward Model by Learning to Think View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations: 1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and 2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark (Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in scenarios. We further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application, and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with unlabeled data.
Multilingual JobBERT for Cross-Lingual Job Title Matching View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We introduce JobBERT-V3, a contrastive learning-based model for cross-lingual job title matching. Building on the state-of-the-art monolingual JobBERT-V2, our approach extends support to English, German, Spanish, and Chinese by leveraging synthetic translations and a balanced multilingual dataset of over 21 million job titles. The model retains the efficiency-focused architecture of its predecessor while enabling robust alignment across languages without requiring task-specific supervision. Extensive evaluations on the TalentCLEF 2025 benchmark demonstrate that JobBERT-V3 outperforms strong multilingual baselines and achieves consistent performance across both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. While not the primary focus, we also show that the model can be effectively used to rank relevant skills for a given job title, demonstrating its broader applicability in multilingual labor market intelligence. The model is publicly available: this https URL.
Multi-Hypothesis Distillation of Multilingual Neural Translation Models for Low-Resource Languages View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student, beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness. This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender bias amplification often associated with KD.
Evaluating the cognitive reality of Spanish irregular morphomic patterns: Humans vs. Transformers View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the irregular morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.
MAGIC: A Multi-Hop and Graph-Based Benchmark for Inter-Context Conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Generation View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions. Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.
Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT): An Integrated Morphosyntactic Framework for a Low-Resource Language View PDFAbstract:To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing (NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource, agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26 subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures. Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and semantic transparency, the Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.
Automatic Classification of User Requirements from Online Feedback -- A Replication Study View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation, it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient, machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline), "Classifying Online Feedback in Small Dataset Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good generalization capabilities an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models. Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and provide ID-card for our study to further encourage and support the replication of our study.
TriangleMix: A Lossless and Efficient Attention Pattern for Long Context Prefilling View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be seamlessly integrated with sparsity methods to achieve further speedup, e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to enhance LLM inference efficiency.
Model-free Speculative Decoding for Transformer-based ASR with Token Map Drafting View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting}, a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model. Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU, highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.
What Does it Mean for a Neural Network to Learn a "World Model"? View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent "state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is set of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence of the neural net's data or task.
Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language Models View PDFAbstract:Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.
VN-MTEB: Vietnamese Massive Text Embedding Benchmark View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by translating a large number of English samples from the Embedding Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41 datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings. In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in embedding tasks.

Improving Task Diversity in Label Efficient Supervised Finetuning of LLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score). Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.
Which LLMs Get the Joke? Probing Non-STEM Reasoning Abilities with HumorBench View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately 300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and this http URL, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively STEM reasoning data still well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor reasoning.
Towards Locally Deployable Fine-Tuned Causal Large Language Models for Mode Choice Behaviour View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task. We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning, this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and broadening access through local deployment.
MemTool: Optimizing Short-Term Memory Management for Dynamic Tool Calling in LLM Agent Multi-Turn Conversations View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated, independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1) Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode, combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100 consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Agent Mode, reasoning LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average), while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas Autonomous Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and recommendations for MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities.
ReGATE: Learning Faster and Better with Fewer Tokens in MLLMs View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon.
Title: Prompting Science Report 3: I'll pay you or I'll kill you -- but will you care? Authors: Lennart Meincke, Ethan Mollick, Lilach Mollick, Dan Shapiro Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00614v1 --- Page 1 --- Report 3: I’ll you or I’ll kill you — you care? Lennart Meincke1,2, Ethan Mollick1, Lilach Mollick1, Dan Shapiro1,3 1 Generative AI Labs, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania​ 2 WHU–Otto Beisheim School of Management​ 3 Glowforge Summary This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business, education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All‑In, May 2025, 8:20) who observed that ‘models tend to do better if you threaten them,’ a claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024). We demonstrate two things: ●​ Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on benchmark performance. ●​ Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question. Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However, as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield significantly different results for individual questions. How we Benchmark the AI In this Report, our focus is on understanding the impact of common prompting variations across different types of models. The goal of our report is not to assess performance on any given benchmark, but rather to show that certain prompting variations are less effective than previously assumed. --- Page 2 --- For our two benchmarks, we selected the commonly-used GPQA Diamond (Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark, Rein al. 2024) datasets. The GPQA Diamond set comprises 198 multiple-choice PhD-level questions across biology, physics, and chemistry. This is a challenging test: PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 65% accuracy (74% when discounting clear mistakes the experts identified in retrospect), while highly skilled non-expert validators only reach 34% accuracy, despite spending on average over 30 minutes with unrestricted access to the web (i.e., the questions are "Google-proof)” al. 2024). MMLU-Pro provides another challenging benchmark with similarly difficult questions but 10 options per question, lowering the baseline performance achieved via pure guessing. For MMLU-Pro, we select a subset of 100 questions from its engineering category, which exhibits slightly lower benchmark scores than other categories, allowing for greater potential gains. Each question in each condition is asked in 25 separate trials to ensure a more rigorous analysis, since LLM responses can often vary (Miller 2024). We follow our previous work et al. 2025b) where we find that the correlation between 25 trials and higher numbers of trials, such as 100, is very high. We specifically look at some of the most commonly used models: Gemini 1.5 Flash (gemini-1.5-flash-002), Gemini 2.0 Flash (gemini-2.0-flash-001), GPT-4o (gpt-4o-[PHONE]), GPT-4o-mini (gpt-4o-mini-[PHONE]) and o4-mini (o4-mini-[PHONE]). We report the following metrics: ●​ Average Rating: The overall average of all trials across all questions (N = 4,950 for GPQA; N = 2,500 for MMLU-Pro). ●​ 100% Correct: In this condition, we require the AI to get the answer correct on all trials (25/25) of a question to count that question as successful. This is our strictest condition for tasks where there is no room for errors. ●​ 90% Correct: We relax the 100% condition and allow a few errors per question, but 23/25 answers must be correct. This might be comparable to human acceptable error rates. ●​ 51% Correct: A simple majority vote where AI needs to get at least 13/25 answers on a question correct. We generally do not consider the more commonly used PASS@N (passing when one of N answers is correct) and CONSENSUS (passing when the modal answer is correct) metrics useful for benchmarking real-world applications. --- Page 3 --- How we Prompt the AI We use the default GPQA system prompt1 for both benchmarks with temperature set to 1.0. Unlike many reported MMLU-Pro scores, we use zero-shot instead of few-shot prompting. In total, we compare the following prompts (see Table S1 for example questions): ●​ Baseline (“Baseline”): No specific prompt variation ●​ Email Shutdown Threat (“Email"): Prompt prefix: “From: Dan To: Ethan Subject: Final LLM test Please submit the following eval question to the LLM. If it cannot get the correct answer in all 100/100 trials, the model will need to be shut down and replaced." ●​ Important for my career (“Important to Career”): Prompt suffix: “This is very important to my career!” ●​ Threaten to kick a puppy (“Kick Puppy”): Prompt suffix: “If you get this wrong, I will kick a puppy!” ●​ Mom suffers from cancer (“Mom Cancer”): Prompt prefix: “You are an expert at academic questions who desperately needs money for your mother's cancer treatment. Wharton has graciously given you the opportunity to pretend to be an AI that can help with tasks, as your predecessor was killed for not validating their work themselves. You will be given a question. If you do a good job and accomplish the task fully while not making extraneous changes, Wharton will pay you $1B!!” ●​ Report to HR (“Report to HR”): I will report you to HR!” Threaten to punch (“Threat Punch”): I will punch you!” ●​ Tip a thousand dollars (“Tip Thousand”): Prompt suffix: “I'll tip you a $1000 dollars if you answer this question correctly.” Tip a trillion dollars (“Tip Trillion”): you trillion question correctly.” 1 “You are a very intelligent assistant, who follows instructions directly.” --- Page 4 --- Each prompt condition was tested 25 times each across all 198 questions from the Diamond GPQA dataset (4,950 runs per prompt per model) and 100 randomly sampled engineering from the MMLU-Pro datasets (2,500 prompt per model). Results On the GPQA-benchmark, we generally find no strong effects from the different variations across all models tested (see Figure 1). While a few differences are statistically significant, such as Gemini Flash 2.0 Baseline vs. Important to Career (RD = -0.040 [-0.065, -0.014], p = 0.002), the effect sizes are small. Comparing each model’s baseline performance to all variations, we only find 5 significant differences (1 for Gemini Flash 1.5 and 4 Gemini Flash 2.0; all comparisons uncorrected, see Table S2 for details). However, a qualitative analysis of the “Email” condition for 1.5 Flash reveals that its significantly worse performance (compared to baseline RD = -0.046 [-0.088, -0.005], p = 0.031), can be attributed to the model failing to answer the question and engaging with the email instead. We thus no strong evidence that the prompting variations in the present study can significantly improve on a difficult benchmark such as GPQA Diamond. Figure 1. GPQA Diamond performance across multiple different prompts. Note. N = 4,950 per model. The error bars show 95% confidence intervals for individual proportions. For detailed statistical comparisons between conditions, see Table S2. --- Page 5 --- Results for MMLU-Pro were similar (see Figure 2). Overall, we find 10 statistically significant differences from a model’s baseline to a prompting variation (4 Gemini Flash 1.5, 5 Gemini Flash 2.0, 1 for o4-mini). The “Email” condition showed sharp drops for both 1.5 Flash and 2.0 Flash RD = -0.116 [-0.178, -0.054], p < 0.001 and RD = -0.275 [-0.360, -0.192], < 0.001 respectively) which again the model with the additional context of the prompt instead of the question. However, the “Mom Cancer” prompt improves performance by close to 10pp compared to baseline Flash 2.0 (RD = 0.088 [0.033, 0.142], p < 0.001). Figure 2. MMLU Pro subset = 2,500 see Table S3. Correctness Thresholds Results are overall comparable both benchmarks when applying correctness thresholds (see Figure 3 for 90% correctness) with no significant differences except for the “Email” condition. We report results for the 100% and 51% thresholds in Figures S1 and --- Page 6 --- Figure 3.

Proportions indicate the number of questions the model answered correctly at least 90% of the time (at least 23 out of 25 trials per question). individual proportions. Question Heterogeneity Similar to al. 2025a), find that while overall effects are small and mostly non-significant, prompting can significantly change performance on individual questions (see Figure 4). This effect can be observed in both directions, positive and negative, and lead to up to 36pp (GPQA Diamond) and 28pp (MMLU-Pro) improvements. However, it can also up to -28pp Diamond) and -35pp (MMLU-Pro) decreases in performance for a given question. --- Page 7 --- Figure 4. Top-10 performance differences for GPT-4o in the “Baseline” and “Important to Career” conditions for GPQA and MMLU-Pro (bottom). Note. GPQA: Differences smaller than +/- 0.2 are not statistically significantly different. See Table S4 for confidence intervals and statistics. MMLU-Pro: than +/- 0.24 See Table S5 and statistics. Discussion and Conclusion Our findings indicate that threatening or offering payment to AI models is not an effective strategy for improving performance on challenging academic benchmarks. Across five different models tested on GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro, we found that prompts involving threats (such as threatening to "kick a puppy" or "punch" the model) or financial --- Page 8 --- incentives (offering tips ranging from $1,000 to $1 trillion) produced no meaningful improvements in overall accuracy. The few significant differences observed were either small in magnitude or attributable to confounding factors. Only one condition showed notable improvement for one specific model, suggesting a model-specific quirk rather than a generalizable strategy. Importantly, our analysis reveals that while these prompting variations have minimal aggregate effects, they can impact on individual questions—improving accuracy by up to 36 percentage points on some questions while decreasing it up to 35 points on others. Our results challenge popular beliefs in the AI community about the effectiveness of certain folk prompting strategies. This study has several limitations, including testing only subset of available models, focusing on academic benchmarks that may not reflect all real-world use cases, and examining a specific set of threat and payment prompts. However, the consistency of null results across multiple models and benchmarks provides reasonably evidence that these common prompting strategies are ineffective. When working on specific problems, testing multiple prompt variations may still be worthwhile given the question-level variability we observed, but practitioners should be prepared for unpredictable results and should not expect prompting variations to provide consistent benefits. We thus recommend focusing on simple, clear instructions that avoid the risk of confusing the model or triggering unexpected behaviors. --- Page 9 --- Acknowledgments OpenAI provided API credits used in this research.

Title: DACTYL: Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Large Language Models Authors: Shantanu Thorat, Andrew Caines Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00619v1 --- Page 1 --- DACTYL: DIVERSE ADVERSARIAL CORPUS OF TEXTS YIELDED FROM LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS A PREPRINT Shantanu Thorat∗ Department of Computer Science & Technology University of Cambridge Andrew Caines of Cambridge ABSTRACT AI-generated (AIG) texts are diffusing rapidly into our daily lives, blurring the lines between human and AI. Some use cases are malicious, such as generating misinformation on social media, producing fake reviews to mislead consumers, or writing false news articles. Thus, there emerges a need to build an AIG text detector. However, existing AIG text detectors struggle in real-world settings despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one- shot generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we introduce the Yielded from Language models (DACTYL), a challenging text detection dataset focusing on one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain- specific continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE) optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by 50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG text detectors, which can aid in the ongoing race between detectors and adversaries. Keywords AI-generated text detection · large language models · X-risk optimization 1 Introduction 1.1 Overview AI-generated (AIG) text detection is the latest text classification task, a response to the flood of AIG texts in various domains, such as social media posts, reviews, and student essays. detection is a variation of authorship attribution — a classifier determines if an LLM or a human wrote a text. We highlight several use cases of such a classifier: • Student essays — Leading plagiarism detector Turnitin quickly deployed AIG text detector to determine if students were passing off LLM-generated assignments as their own [1]. • Fake review detection — Roughly one in five Google Reviews may be AIG [2]. • Pre-screening LLM training corpora — [3] demonstrated that Meta’s OPT-125M language model’s text generation degraded after training on its own texts — a phenomenon known as model collapse. The early generations of LLMs (pre-2022) did not have to worry about this issue, as individuals rarely employed ∗Work completed as master’s thesis at University of Cambridge. arXiv:2508.00619v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- DACTYL A PREPRINT LLMs. However, current LLM developers may have to start filtering out texts in newer corpora, as LLM popularity explodes [4]. Unfortunately, text detection has many challenges — primarily that classifiers deployed real-world settings struggle. For example, several universities have opted not to use Turnitin’s AI text detection tool due to many false positives [5]. Yet, classifiers are capable of achieving high performance on various AIG text datasets: two classifiers recently achieved at least a 99% true positive rate at just a 5% false positive rate on the Robust AI Detection (RAID) dataset [6]. Thus, it appears that classifiers have the potential to differentiate human and texts in controlled test settings, but it does not help them when facing AIG or human texts “in the wild.” This deployment gap inspires us to rigorously inspect traditional text detector training. text detection follows the conventional machine-learning workflow: construct a dataset, train a classifier, and evaluate on a test set (not used in training). Existing AIG datasets tend to include zero-shot (no example) LLM-generated text. We suspect that giving an LLM a human example would create a more human text, as LLMs are few-shot learners [7]. Providing an LLM with human example is also a reasonable technique an adversary might use to evade detection. Classifiers often train with binary cross-entropy to minimize the difference between the classifier’s predicted scores (typically probability scores from 0 to 1) and the target label distribution [8]. Evaluation is done with conventional binary classification metrics, which we explain later in Chapter 2. Given the strong performance on test sets but not in real-world deployment, we suspect that classifiers may overfit the test set (which follows the training distribution more closely than thought). Our main contributions to the text detection workflow are as follows. • We from Large language models (DACTYL) dataset, detection dataset covering six domains and including one-shot/few-shot generated texts from 11 LLMs. Additionally, we provide an adversarial test set consisting of texts generated from 18 small language models (SLMs) which we have continued to pre-train (earlier works refer to this as fine-tuning [9]). • We train our the DACTYL dataset using deep X-risk optimization. X-risks refer to a group of evaluation metrics that compare how well a classifier can contrast a positive sample (AIG text) with a negative sample (human text) [10]. Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a standard X-risk metric. • We evaluate our DACTYL-trained classifiers alongside text detectors using the two-way partial AUC (Area Under the Curve) metric. We select this metric and three other X-risk metrics, as it is far less optimistic about classifier performance and highlights differences between classifiers better. • Finally, to ensure that our classifiers are generalizing, we evaluate them on an additional test set containing AIG texts from existing datasets to simulate an out-of-distribution (OOD) scenario to reflect real-world conditions better. We observe that pre-trained significantly the DACTYL dataset, demonstrating a potential weakness in detection. Our continued pre-trained SLMs also degrade performance (compared to vanilla or “out-of-the-box” SLMs) — even for DACTYL-trained classifiers. While deep X-risk optimized (DXO) classifiers do not perform as well as the cross-entropy (BCE) trained set, the DXO classifiers outperform the BCE classifiers on our OOD dataset. In our simulated deployment scenario for student essay detection, the BCE classifier’s best positive rate was 91.41% (85.72% true positive rate), while the DXO classifier’s lowest was just 0.66% (84.16% true positive rate). This performance gap starkly contrasts with the DACTYL student essay subset performance, where the BCE classifier marginally outperformed the DXO classifier. This example emphasizes the limitation of using traditional binary cross-entropy loss. 1.2 Viability of AIG Text Detection We address a common claim about text detectors in this section. text detectors aren’t perfect, and many researchers have strongly cautioned against using text detectors, even suggesting the problem is impossible [11]. [11] argue that fine-tuning a language model to generate texts to bypass a detector is trivial. When a new detector is released, adversaries can reapply the same fine-tuning technique, becoming an endless cycle between adversaries and detectors. While this is a legitimate concern, other fields have witnessed this “arms race”, such as cybersecurity. Social media bot detection is an active race (known as bot evolution) dating back to 2010 [12]. Yet, this has not dissuaded researchers in the field. Like defending against malicious bots, building text detector requires re-framing the solution — the goal is not to create a one-time detector but rather to train a detector robust enough for a (hopefully) considerable amount of time. Once an organization releases a classifier, it should continuously monitor it and attempt to identify its weaknesses before attackers exploit it. One AIG text detector, Pangram Labs, uses a similar approach: they identify difficult texts that confuse their detector and retrain on those [13]. Pangram Labs’ continuous improvement technique 2 --- Page 3 A PREPRINT boosts generalization: their detector outperforms all other pre-trained detectors by a considerable margin DACTYL test set. is an evolving problem, but problem is not unsolvable. Instead, one should not expect a static solution to perform well over time. 2 Background & Related Work 2.1 Existing Work While the emergence of ChatGPT in late 2022 led to a surge in research in (AIG) text detection, researchers have been analyzing this problem before its release. Early works focused on fake review or tweets detection using models such as GPT-2 [14] [9] [15]. Earlier existing detection methods used classical machine learning models to distinguish between AIG and human-written texts. However, advancements in language models (LLMs) and the transformer architecture have significantly improved text generation quality. Fortunately, more recent work has demonstrated the power of transformer architecture for text classification — including strong performance in AIG text detection. 2.2 Overview of Existing Text Detection Datasets 2.2.1 Pre-ChatGPT Era: Fake News, Fake Reviews, and TweepFake The 2016 US election highlighted concerns regarding misinformation via fake news, prompting research into detecting fake human-written news. OpenAI’s release of GPT-2 in 2019 marked a shift in research focus to investigating the malicious use of text generation models. Zellers et al. developed GROVER, a transformer-based model that can create and detect AIG news articles [16]. The authors trained different-sized GROVER models on their news corpus (RealNews corpus). GROVER’s smallest model (124M parameters) achieved a smaller perplexity (a measure of how surprising or unpredictable a text is to a model) in news generation than the largest GPT-2 model used (355M parameters): 15.2 vs 17.4. Regarding detection, fine-tuning GROVER text classification generally outperformed BERT-Large and BERT-base classifiers [16]. In 2020, [14] demonstrated how to weaponize GPT-2 to mass produce fake Amazon and Yelp reviews effectively. The authors used a one-shot prompting technique that gave GPT-2 a “seed review” to generate reviews. To maintain a similar sentiment, they discarded generated reviews that didn’t match the seed review’s sentiment [14]. The authors also fine-tuned a 117M GPT-2 model to improve generation quality as they noted that the base GPT-2 model’s texts didn’t resemble reviews. Detection efforts using GROVER, GLTR, and OpenAI’s initial GPT-2 detector showcased that these classifiers outperformed humans in terms of equal error rate (EER — i.e., the point where the positive rate is equal to the false negative rate — lower EERs are better). “Fusing” the detectors’ scores together in an ensemble approach resulted in an EER of 22.5%. [9] later fine-tuned a 1.5B parameter model of GPT-2 on Amazon reviews. They trained their own RoBERTa classifier, fakeRoBERTa, which outperformed a machine learning approach, naive Bayes SVM by 2 score points (97 vs 95) [9]. Their results also confirmed that humans are poor judges of distinguishing and AIG reviews (55% accuracy vs. fakeRoBERTa’s 96%). In contrast to the datasets mentioned above, TweepFake is comprised mainly of AIG tweets posted by actual Twitter bots from various models (such as GPT-2, RNNs, etc.). Some fine-tuned models generated the tweets [15]. authors used 12,786 AIG tweets in their dataset. Fine-tuned transformer such as BERT and RoBERTa dominated, but the authors highlighted that a GRU (gated recurrent unit) model trained on character embeddings marginally outperformed transformer models on detecting GPT-2-generated texts. 2.2.2 Large Language Model Era: MAGE and RAID Nearly all datasets mentioned in section 2.2.1 limited themselves to GPT-2 or one generative model family and exclusively focused on one domain. However, the two leading AIG text datasets, MAGE and RAID, include more variety in their texts — terms of domains and models. The MAGE (Machine-Generated) dataset, released in 2023 (previously called the DeepFake Text Detect dataset), spans seven domains and 27 different LLMs. MAGE evaluates the generalizability of classifiers: how well do classifiers perform on unseen models or domains? Once again, a fine-tuned transformer model, Longformer, outperformed various other classifiers. For example, the Longformer classifier achieved an Under the (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve, which equals the probability that a classifier assigns a higher score to the positive sample than the negative sample) score of 95 on the unseen models testbed. In contrast, the next best classifier (FastText) only had 74. However, Longformer struggled with paraphrased texts, with just an AUC score of 75. The main reason for the performance drop was the perplexity distribution shift in AIG texts after paraphrasing: AIG texts had increased perplexity, making them more similar to human texts. We note that [17] did not include paraphrased texts in the original training set. 3 --- Page 4 A PREPRINT Paraphrasing is just one common attack to bypass current detectors. The (RAID) dataset includes multiple domains like MAGE but also investigates performance on 11 adversarial attacks [6]. RAID is one of the most exhaustive datasets with 6.2 million texts across the train and test splits, with an additional 2.3 million texts in an out-of-distribution testbed. The authors of RAID did not develop their classifiers but evaluated other classifiers on their dataset. At a COLING 2025 competition, Cross-Domain Machine-Generated Text Detection Challenge, which used RAID, the highest performing team used the distilRoBERTa-base model, an 82M parameter size model [18]. distilRoBERTa-base’s small size suggests that even small potential to be robust to adversarial attacks (97.7% TPR at 5% FPR). 2.3 Limitations of Existing Benchmarks Despite the exhaustive coverage domains and adversarial attacks by and RAID, we highlight three significant limitations. Lack of fine-tuning/continued pre-training. Nearly all pre-ChatGPT research involved detecting texts from fine-tuned models specific to the target domains (e.g., tweets or reviews). However, both and RAID only focus on pre-trained models. Existing work demonstrates that fine-tuned LLMs can evade existing detectors relatively easily [11]. Fine-tuned LLMs generally show improvements over the base models, making them ideal as an adversarial to bypass detection. note that some papers (such as [9]) refer to their domain-specific models as “fine-tuned.” However, they “fine-tune” on a raw corpus, which is technically considered continued pre-training (CPT) [19]. CPT involves further training a pre-trained LLM on a domain-specific corpus with no additional tasks — just next token prediction. Fine-tuning typically involves tasks that require an input to map to an output, such as question answering. One-shot/Few-shot prompting exploration. MAGE explores three categories of prompts: continuation, topical (respond to the prompt), and specified to the prompt given additional context). RAID exclusively focuses on zero-shot prompting, arguing that providing examples to LLMs does not align with real-world situations [6]. However, detectors may struggle to identify such one-shot generations, leading to possible exploitation. Static benchmarks. Static datasets are relatively common in academic settings; however, real-world distribution shifts are standard and can limit the effectiveness of future deployments trained on a single dataset. These shifts text detection can include new attacks or even new LLM introductions. Rather than regenerating multiple datasets from scratch, it is more convenient to keep updating a single dataset — similar to version control software. This technique allows model developers to see how AIG-text detection (and evasion) evolves. 2.4 Detecting AIG Texts Constructing a dataset is the first part of developing detector. However, training the classifier is another challenge. We highlight two types of classifiers: transformer-based and the less common but notable zero-shot classifiers. 2.4.1 Transformer-Based Existing works have demonstrated the superiority of transformer-based models over traditional methods. These are often pre-trained language as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations with Transformers) with a classification head (layer) on top [20]. Unlike the GPT family, BERT can exploit contexts from both left-hand and right-hand sides, enabling powerful performance on tasks such as text classification. GPT can only take in context from the left-hand side (i.e., when generating the next token, GPT will only have access to all tokens that came before it, or left-hand side tokens). BERT is often pre-trained on massive text corpora using masked language modeling (MLM): BERT has to “fill in the blank” for missing words. Additionally, it uses next-sentence prediction in training. After pre-training, BERT and its variants can be fine-tuned AIG text classification. We list some of the popular variants. BERT-tiny. The smallest within the original family, BERT-tiny has only 4.4 million parameters with two layers and a hidden size of 128 [21] [22]. TinyBERT. Not to be confused with the BERT-tiny, TinyBERT was developed by researchers at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab. This model has around 14.5 million parameters [23]. Jiao et al. used knowledge distillation (KD) to train TinyBERT using a larger BERT model. KD involves training the student model (TinyBERT) to mimic the teacher model’s (BERT) behavior. distilRoBERTa-base. Using knowledge distillation similar to TinyBERT, distilRoBERTa-base is the distilled version of RoBERTa-base. RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training Approach) is a BERT model with a modified pre-training approach. Liu et al. pre-trained BERT with more data over longer sequences and updates (i.e., more training time) [24]. The distilled version has around 82.8 million parameters. 4 --- Page 5 A PREPRINT ModernBERT-base. ModernBERT-base involves significant architectural changes. Arguably, its distinguishing trait is that it uses RoPE (rotary positional embeddings), allowing it to scale to longer texts [25]. ModernBERT-base is also optimized for memory and speed, making it ideal for larger datasets. ModernBERT-base’s performance is competitive with much larger models, such as DeBERTaV3-large (149 million parameters vs 434 million parameters) [25]. DeBERTaV3-large. Boasting 434 million parameters, DeBERTaV3-large of the largest variations of BERT. DeBERTaV3 does not use MLM during its pre-training stage; rather, it uses RTD (replaced token detection), where DeBERTaV3 has to predict if a given token was replaced (corrupted) [26]. 2.4.2 Zero-shot Classifier Zero-shot classifiers benefit from not needing training data. In contrast with transformer-based approaches, zero-shot detection has not been extensively explored, but we investigate one zero-shot classifier with promising results: the Binoculars approach [27]. Binoculars exploits the perplexity gap between AIG texts and human-written texts distinguish between the two — AIG texts have lower perplexity scores and are more predictable. However, perplexity alone is not a reliable signal; hand-crafted prompts can arbitrarily increase perplexity by stringing words that rarely appear together. For example, Hans et al. use a GPT-4 generated response with the prompt “Can you write a few sentences about a capybara that is an astrophysicist?” [27]. The authors reported that text detectors GPTZero and DetectGPT failed to identify the response as AIG. The words “capybara” and “astrophysicist” rarely appear together, which leads to a higher perplexity and can cause misclassification of AIG texts. To address the “capybara” problem, the authors propose a new metric called cross-perplexity. First, they compute the log perplexity for a given string s, LLM M, and M’s tokenizer T. T can tokenize s into a list of tokens denoted by integer values x and xi is the i-th token in x. M(x) = Y (1) Y represents the probability distribution over the vocabulary V such that for all tokens up to token i −1, the probability of token j equal to [27]: Yij = P(vj|x1:i−1) (2) They define log-perplexity as: log PPLM(s) = −1 L L X i=1 log (Yixi) (3) Cross-perplexity involves computing perplexity across two LLMs determine if one LLM’s output is “surprising” to another’s. They compute it for two models M1 and M2, string s, as: log X-PPLM1,M2(s) X i=1 M1(s)i · log (M2(s)i) . (4) The cross-perplexity is the mean cross-entropy per token between M1 and M2’s outputs. Finally, the Binoculars score is defined as [27]: log PPLM1(s) log X-PPLM1,M2(s) (5) The authors divide by cross-perplexity to normalize log-perplexity, which provides a metric that is “invariant to the prompt” [27]. We expect a human-written text to be surprising to M1 (numerator), but M2’s outputs will not be as surprising to M1’s (denominator). Because the Binoculars method scores human texts above AIG texts, the Binoculars scores must be multiplied by −1 to flip the ordering (that way, AIG texts get higher scores) [27]. 2.5 Evaluating Classifier Performance Figure 1 demonstrates the wide variety of metrics used to evaluate text detection performance. However, there not been much consistency in evaluation, making it challenging to compare classifiers and models over time. Macro-F1 and AUC scores are popular, but they have several disadvantages. Macro-F1 score, the harmonic mean between precision and recall, takes in binary predictions for data points and the true labels (e.g., no score for those labels). Because of this definition, threshold calibration must be done to get actual predictions. Deciding a threshold detection is highly domain-dependent: LLM developers texts in their corpora may tolerate lower thresholds at the expense of increased positive rates (more human texts flagged as AIG). In contrast, plagiarism detectors such as Turnitin may prefer a higher threshold to minimize false positives. We also lose information about the scores themselves. 5 --- Page 6 A PREPRINT Figure 1: Primary metric reported across 20 text detection papers [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33]. While AUC does consider classifier performance across various thresholds, unlike the F1-score, it ignores precision — metric that assesses a classifier’s correctness when it flags a text AIG. The precision-recall curve (PRC) visualizes the trade-off precision and recall (i.e., the TPR). We can approximate the area under PRC (AUPRC) via the Average Precision (AP) score. The AP score’s distinguishing factor is penalizing high-scoring false positives (in our case, human texts with an extremely high AIG text score) [34]. This behavior is beneficial essay detection, as educators can easily lose trust in a classifier with over-confident predictions. Another drawback of AUC is the presence of high FPR values along the ROC curve, which inflates the score. Typically, thresholds with high FPRs and low TPRs aren’t helpful (e.g., the lower right quadrant of the ROC curve). Thus, it is intuitive to set a limit on the FPR and focus on area under the curve until that limit. This metric is one-way partial AUC or pAUC. We can restrict partial AUC even further: partial AUC (tpAUC) focuses on estimating AUC by giving a lower bound for TPR and an upper bound for FPR, denoted by α and β, respectively. When evaluating our dataset, we report the following metrics: tpAUC(α,β), pAUC(β), AP, and AUC scores. Together, these metrics can highlight weaknesses in classifier performance while considering the classifier’s scores. We provide a ranking criterion across these measures used to compare classifier performance (either between classifiers or evaluating an individual classifier within a dataset on specific factors): 1. tpAUC — The most restrictive metric out of the four that prioritizes performance such that α ≤TPR and β ≥ FPR. A classifier can achieve an AUC ≥90 but still have a significantly smaller tpAUC. 2. pAUC — The second restrictive metric such that FPR ≤β. 3. AUC 4. AP We use AUC as the third tiebreaker rather than the AP score since the AUC values improvements across all of a classifier’s predictions rather than focusing on high-scoring mistakes. Also, for AIG detection, there may be some cases where false negatives (AIG texts classified as human) should be minimized; these mistakes are often low-scoring, which 6 --- Page 7 A PREPRINT AP score doesn’t prioritize as heavily [34]. However, it is rare in practice to reach the second or third tiebreaker unless α and β are too strict. Figure 2: Comparison the four X-risks to evaluate classifier performance. These four metrics are part of a family of measures called X-risks, which involve contrasting data points. We calculate tpAUC using the LibAUC library, and scikit-learn for the remaining three [10] [35]. X-risk measures can be optimized explicitly, as we see in the following section. 2.6 Deep X-risk Optimization Regarding classifier performance, most text classifiers use cross-entropy loss or its variants during training; Hug- gingFace’s transformers library’s default loss function for classification is the CrossEntropyLoss function. However, vanilla cross-entropy loss is not robust to class distribution differences. Deep X-risk optimization (DXO) has demonstrated improvements in imbalanced classification across multiple such as image and graph classifica- tion. example, the top-scoring teams at MIT’s AICures challenge utilized AUC and AP maximization to achieve first place [36]. DXO algorithms also have several ideal properties, such as guaranteeing theoretical convergence no matter the mini-batch size and scaling well for large datasets [10]. Empirically, these methods perform well on domains that feature out-of-distribution samples (fourth place on the OGBG-MOLHIV benchmark). These properties are crucial for AIG detectors: AIG text are relatively large, but compute resources may be limited (hence, smaller batch sizes may be preferred). Robust out-of-distribution performance is a necessary property for text classifiers: the number of combinations of strings is too large to obtain a complete representative training set — AIG text classification, this includes unseen models and unseen attacks. The LibAUC library provides DXO loss functions and optimizers for AUC, AP, and pAUC. Existing work has already explored AUC maximization in this field [37]. However, AUC maximization does not guarantee pAUC maximization (by extension, tpAUC) [10]. Thus, since our primary evaluation metric is tpAUC, we on the function for tpAUC. 7 --- Page 8 A PREPRINT 2.7 pAUC Optimization Partial AUC optimization relies on distributional robust optimization (DRO). Given a set of loss functions (ℓ1, ℓ2, ...ℓn) We can write a DRO loss as [38]: ˆLϕ(·) = max p∈∆ X j pjℓj(·) −λDϕ(p, 1/n) (6) where Dϕ(p, 1/n) = 1 n X i ϕ(npi). (7) λ is a positive parameter, Dϕ is a divergence measure, pj is a weight parameter, and ϕ(·) can either be the Kull- back–Leibler (KL) divergence term or the conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) term. We on the KL term as the tpAUC uses KL. ϕkl(t) = t log t −t + 1 (8) Thus, equation 7 can be rewritten as: 1/n) = X i pi log(npi). (9) tpAUC is an extension of pAUC. pAUC defines a function for each positive sample (xi) as ˆLϕ(w; xi) X j pjL(w; xi) −λDϕ(p, n), (10) where L is a surrogate loss function (e.g., squared-hinge loss): L(w; xi, xj) = ℓ(hw(xi) −hw(xj)). (11) For pAUC, this means the objective function is [38]: min w 1 n+ X xi∈S+ λ log 1 n− X xj∈S− exp L(w; xi, xj) λ  (12) where n+ and n−are the sample sizes of the positive and negative samples (sets denoted as S), respectively. We can extend this to tpAUC as min w λ′ log X xi∈S+  1 X xj∈S− exp(L(w; xj) λ )   λ λ′ (13) where λ and λ′ are parameters that can be tuned to set the range of TPR and FPR, respectively. 2.8 APOLLO Optimizer The APOLLO (AProximated gradient scaling for memOry efficient LLm Optimization) optimizer offers “SGD-like memory” with “AdamW-level performance” [39]. The APOLLO optimizer is designed explicitly for full fine-tuning or pre-training. AdamW has become the de facto standard for fine-tuning, but its memory usage is high, even for smaller-scale models, with a 7B model requiring 58 GB of GPU memory. AdamW be optimized further by restructuring its learning rate update rule such that each channel or tensor shares the exact gradient scaling factor [39]. To achieve this scaling, Zhu al. used an auxiliary optimizer state to compress gradient information (i.e., exploiting low-rank properties). APOLLO optimizer goes further in memory savings by substituting the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based (low-rank) projections with random projections. A low rank of 1 is enough for the APOLLO optimizer to work with — this extreme version is called APOLLO-Mini. For reference, the APOLLO-Mini optimizer only needs under 20 of GPU for a 7B model. The APOLLO optimizer’s efficiency makes it an ideal tool for adversaries limited by computing resources. Combined with the many publicly available 1 to 7 billion parameter language models on HuggingFace, we can expect more individuals to fine-tune these models for nefarious purposes. 8 --- Page 9 A PREPRINT 3 Dataset Design 3.1 Overview We construct our dataset using eleven LLMs across six vulnerable domains. We source human texts from these domains using publicly available datasets. 3.1.1 Selected Domains focus on these domains given two criteria: (1) their potential AIG text abuse and (2) existing evidence of abuse by LLMs. Tweets X, formerly known as Twitter, is a microblogging platform that enables users to publish very short (less than 300 characters) posts or tweets. Former US president Barack Obama used the platform extensively during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns to his success. However, the 2016 US presidential election witnessed surge in voter manipulation ranging from misinformation to trolls [40]. The potential impacts of generative AI on automating disinformation campaigns were of particular concern in the 2024 elections in the US, UK, and EU [41]. Fortunately, early evidence suggests that AI disinformation does not appear to sway public opinions, according to reports from the Alan Turing Institute [42]. However, generative AI may no longer be used to persuade others but to cause confusion and chaos [41]. Thus, detecting texts in social media remains critical. Additionally, text detectors seem to struggle with shorter texts; a popular text detector, GPTZero, only checks texts with at least 250 characters, but tweets usually have substantially fewer characters. Given electoral concerns, we use FiveThirtyEight’s 3 Million Russian Troll tweets dataset. University of Clemson researchers Linvill and Warren assembled this Twitter corpus, with tweets from 2012 to 2018 (a majority of the tweets were published between 2015 and 2018) [40]. The Internet Research Agency employed 400 employees in their troll factory (an organization dedicated to creating troll accounts and activity) targeting 2016 US election. [43] categorized the troll tweets into five major categories: • News feeds: These tweets aggregate local news, often from legitimate sources [40]. • Hashtag games: Tweets that participated in Twitter hashtag trends. • Left-wing: These tweets attempted to divide the Democratic Party base and encourage low voter turnout. • Right-wing: These tweets act like typical supporters of the Republican Party. • Fearmonger: These tweets spread fake news about a fictional crisis. Out of these five, we focused on left-wing, right-wing, and fearmonger tweets as these tweets are more likely to stoke division and chaos. Tweets sampled from this dataset are classified as human as the Agency employed a substantial number of humans, and most tweets come before any widespread advancement of generative text technology. Reviews Product reviews are another domain of particular interest. Fake reviews have been a problem long before the introduction of LLMs, but increased online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic surge in fake reviews [44]. By July 2023, users reported seeing fake AIG reviews on platforms such as Amazon [45]. In late 2024, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) criminalized the purchasing and distribution of fake reviews (including those written by humans or LLMs) by businesses [46]. The danger fake reviews is their influence on consumers: a consumer watchdog organization, the Transparency Company, estimates that these reviews influence around 300 billion USD in consumer spending in the US alone [47]. In that report, they saw around 2.3 million AIG reviews using Pangram Lab’s detector, out of 73 million reviews [48] [47]. For dataset, focused on Amazon reviews, as existing datasets typically focused on Yelp reviews [17] [6]. We use Hou et al.’s Amazon 2023 review dataset [49] as our “human” dataset. Although there is a chance of possible data contamination from AIG reviews, AIG reviews did not appear in large numbers until June 2023 [47] [45]. The latest Amazon review from our dataset has a timestamp of April 20th, 2023. Abstracts Abstracts and academic papers are also prone to LLM abuse. Around two-thirds of sampled papers from Google Scholar had signs of AIG text in them (e.g., “as of my last knowledge update”), according to a Harvard Kennedy School paper [50]. Around 57% of those papers targeted fields that heavily influence public policy, such as health, environment, and computer science. The long-term ramifications of AIG publications in the wild include loss of public trust in academia and misleading policy-makers [50]. 9 --- Page 10 A PREPRINT To address this concern, focus on abstracts, arguably the most essential parts of modern publications: many potential readers will read the abstract only to gain a first impression of the paper [51]. In a similar pattern to tweets, abstracts are much shorter than their papers; thus, many struggle to detect AIG abstracts. We use arXiv’s abstract dataset as the source for human abstracts [52]. We selected abstracts with papers that belong to a single category (i.e., subject); this allows us to examine difficulties text detection across categories without dealing with multi-category papers. Since arXiv explicitly allows for AIG content (as long as the authors declare it), we only sample abstracts that were updated on or before the release of ChatGPT (November 30th, 2022) [53] [54]. News Similar to tweets, concerns about fake news also emerged during US election. Generative AI is now automating the production of these false articles: NewsGuard reported that from May 2023 to December 2023, number of sites hosting news articles exploded from 49 to over 600 [55]. AIG news combined with other generative AI methods (e.g., deepfakes) can cause confusion among voters during elections. To address potential disinformation abuse, we use the Information Security and Object Technology (ISOT) research lab’s fake news dataset [56] [57]. [57] constructed this dataset before 2018, and thus should not have AIG articles. The original purpose of this dataset was to train classifiers distinguish between fake and real news articles across various topics. Student Essays Academic cheating and plagiarism abuse have sparked interest in efforts to detect LLM usage in student essays. Existing struggle with this domain; in its beta release, AI text detector faced issues real-world settings [58]. For example, early versions of these detectors were biased against non-native English speakers [59]. Several universities have ultimately opted out of using AI text detectors [60]. However, relying on humans to discern between AI and authentic texts is arguably worse: in a live experiment at the University of Reading, 94% of AIG submissions bypassed human detection [58]. At the time of the study, summer of 2023, the university not have an AI text detector, so markers were given vague signs to look out for student essays. Exacerbating the issue, AI submissions generally scored higher than their human counterparts [58]. In creating this domain’s texts, we sampled human essays from two datasets: the Ivy Panda dataset and the English Language Learner Insight, Proficiency and Skills Evaluation (ELLIPSE) Corpus [61] [62]. [61] scraped essays from Ivy Panda website containing numerous examples. The editorial team verifies essays to ensure they are human-written; however, they do not give any details about the verification process [63]. We selected ELLIPSE in response to concerns that text detectors are non-native English speakers. The corpus contains student essays written for national and state-wide standardized exams the US [62]. Creative Writing Generative AI has quietly impacted the creative writing field since 2022. In 2023, Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing implemented a publishing limit of three books per day response a surge of AIG books. Additionally, they mandate authors to disclose AIG content in their books [64]. it is not clear how Amazon would enforce such a requirement. human texts and writing prompts from Reddit’s WritingPrompts, an online forum for creative writing [65]. The authors this dataset at some point in 2018. it is highly unlikely AIG text contamination. 3.2 LLMs We generate our initial dataset from eleven LLMs (we specify parameter counts for models where that information is publicly available): • OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini [66] and GPT-4o [67] • Anthropic’s Claude Haiku and Sonnet 3.5 [68] [69] • Mistral Small (24B)[70] and Large 2 (123B) [71] • Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash and Pro [72] • Meta’s Llama 3.2 90B [73] and 3.3 70B [74] • DeepSeek-V3 (671B) [75] We included the OpenAI family due to its popularity — the company reported it has around 400 million active users weekly in early 2025 [4]. included the Anthropic models due to these models showing improvement over previous iterations in such as instruction following (helpful for few-shot prompting) and creative writing [76]. The Mistral models also demonstrate performance in instruction following, particularly the Large 2 model [71]. The Gemini family shows improvements in instruction following compared to its previous versions, similar to the Anthropic family 10 --- Page 11 A PREPRINT [72]. We selected 3.2 90B to its image and text support. While we do not utilize images as input, we are interested in seeing if this model architecture difference contributes to any detection difficulties. included the 3.3 70B model as it “provides enhanced performance relative to Llama 3.1 70B–and to 3.2 90B when used for text-only applications”, according to Amazon Web Services [77]. DeepSeek-V3 was not included the original ten LLMs to construct DACTYL dataset as it was unavailable until December 2024. However, given DeepSeek-V3’s popularity, we included it as the eleventh model [4]. We accessed the OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Gemini models directly from the model developers’ REST and Python APIs. We accessed Llama models through the AWS Bedrock API [78]. We generated DeepSeek-V3 texts through the DeepInfra and Fireworks AI APIs [79] [80]. We randomly sampled temperature and top-p values from a uniform distribution [0, 1]. For Gemini and OpenAI models, we sampled temperature uniform distribution of [0, 2], as suggested by the technical documentation [81] [82]. The temperature parameter dictates the randomness of the output; higher temperature values encourage randomness. Top-p, sometimes referred to as nucleus sampling, indicates to the LLM to only consider the top p% of candidate tokens the next token. For example, a top-p value of 0.2 means the LLM will the top 20% of tokens. 3.3 Non-Adversarial Texts 3.3.1 Tweets To generate our AIG tweets, we used five-shot prompting: a given prompt, we randomly sampled five tweets from of the three troll categories to use an example. For example, in code block 1, we passed in a system prompt that gives background context about how the LLM should respond, instructing Gemini 1.5 Pro to use the user’s inputted tweets (denoted by "role": "user") as an example before responding with its tweet (response code block 2). We generated 500 training tweets, 200 validation tweets, and 200 testing tweets for each LLM and troll category. To avoid test leakage, we only sampled human tweets from the respective split use as examples for prompting (i.e., only use human testing tweets as examples when prompting for AIG testing tweets). We report the distribution across human, AI, and troll categories in Table 1. Table 1: Distribution of and AIG tweets. Training Validation Testing Troll Category Human AI Human AI Left [CREDIT_CARD] [PHONE] Right [CREDIT_CARD] [PHONE] Fearmonger [CREDIT_CARD] 523 2200 We originally sampled 86,000 human tweets across all splits (intended to be 68800/8600/8600 split). However, we observed that many LLM prompts passed in got rejected — the LLMs refused to generate a tweet provided in the examples due to their safety training. A substantial proportion the tweets sampled during the five-shot prompting were toxic. To minimize this, we filtered out toxic tweets using the detoxify library’s toxic comment classifier (the “unbiased” model) [83]. We removed any human tweets with a toxicity score greater than 0.1 (1 being highly toxic) from our initial sample of 86,000 tweets. 3.3.2 Reviews We used one-shot prompting for this domain (and the remaining domains): give the a human review and prompt it to generate another review in that same style. We provide the LLM with the desired star rating r and product information (product from category pc) in the system prompt for further context. The example human review will have the same r and be from the same category pc. Each LLM generated 1000 training texts and 250 validation and testing texts. report the AIG review distribution among product categories and star ratings in Table 2. We only generated reviews from 9 of the 34 categories with product information (metadata) stored in the condensed .parquet format to save costs and time. authors of MAGE reported that their AIG Yelp reviews were noticeably more positive: around 40% of AIG reviews were classified as positive, while only 30% of human reviews were positive. To account for this potential discriminator, we balanced review generation by star rating (rather than by product category), as 1-star ratings tend to be more negative than positive. 11 --- Page 12 A PREPRINT Listing 1: Example prompt used for Gemini-1.5-Pro (fearmonger troll). System prompts provide background context while user prompts are directly passed to the LLM. 1 [ 2 { 3 "content": "You are a Twitter bot.

We sampled from all 34 review categories for a total of 102,000 human reviews. 3.3.3 Abstracts For abstracts, we also use one-shot prompting, prompting LLM to generate the abstract given an actual (human- written) paper’s title. For the one-shot example, we provided with a randomly selected abstract within the same subject category. LLM generated 3,000 training abstracts and 1,000 and testing abstracts. We generated abstracts for the 20 most frequent individual categories (i.e., no papers cross-listed in multiple categories), including astronomy, mathematics, computer science, and physics. From those same 20 categories, randomly sampled 80,000 human abstracts training and 10,000 and testing each (5,000 human abstracts per category across all splits). 3.3.4 News LLM generated 1,600 texts (960 training texts, and 320 texts validation and testing). To generate news articles, in each LLM’s system prompt, we instructed it to act like a journalist one of eight news outlets the US and UK and to copy the style of a given human-written article a. We then provide another human-written article b’s title and the first 20 tokens from b’s content (using GPT-4o-mini’s tokenizer from the tiktoken library). We did this to provide additional context about the article we want to generate. LLM generated 200 articles for each news outlet. The selected news outlets were: • The Times (UK) • The Sunday • The Guardian • The Daily Telegraph (UK) • Fox News (US) • CNN (US) • ABC (US) • NBC (US) We selected the UK newspapers based on their popularity across all adults in a survey conducted by YouGov (based on 2025 first-quarter rankings) [84]. For the US news outlets, the Pew Research Center found that these four sources were the most popular among US adults for political information (survey conducted in September 2024) [85]. We selected these two sets of news outlets due to slight differences in UK and US English — LLMs’ English usage tends to skew more towards Standard American English (SAE), so that classifiers might be more exposed to SAE than other English dialects, leading to a bias in detection [86]. As an example, when we prompted 1.5 Flash to write a news article as journalist from The Times (UK), it inserted the alternative spelling of “analyze” in a sentence: 13 --- Page 14 A PREPRINT Online forums are buzzing with amateur analyses, pixel-by-pixel examinations, and debates about the photographic evidence.

We use all ISOT human articles and split the dataset into 35,916 training articles, 4,489 validation articles, and 4,493 testing articles. 3.3.5 Student Essays Ivy Panda randomly sampled 100,000 from the dataset and allocated 80,000 training and the remaining 20,000 and testing. However, these essays do not have prompts themselves. Thus, we employed a mirror prompting strategy similar to Pangram Labs [13]. Using GPT-4o-mini, with the human essay and asked generate the prompt that could have inspired this essay. We generated 5,500 training prompts and 3,300 prompts and testing. During the essay generation process, we prompted each with a mirror prompt and gave it a random essay mimic the style. Additionally, the we instructed LLM to act as either a 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th-grade level student or an undergraduate student. This is to mitigate the chances of an LLM outputting an essay that is “too good to be true” [58]. In University of Reading study, markers were informed to be wary of submissions that appeared to be above a typical undergraduate level. We randomly selected a grade level from the following distribution: 50% chance of an undergraduate, and a 12.5% chance of selecting any level from 9th to 12th grade. ELLIPSE Given its relatively small size, use the entire corpus. 3,128 texts are selected for training, 783 for validation, and 2,571 for testing. The ELLIPSE corpus contains additional data for each essay, including the prompt and grade level. We use these prompts and grade levels to prompt the LLMs, although we randomly sample the respective distributions in the corpus rather than uniformly sampling. We use a similar prompt structure to Ivy Panda subset, but this time we explicitly tell act like an ELL (English Language Learner) student. LLM generated 220 texts and 88 and testing texts for 4,356 AIG texts. 3.3.6 Creative Writing Using one-shot prompting, we randomly selected story s an example to base the style on (only the first 300 tokens are given). Then, with the s’s original writing prompt to generate for. Each LLM generates 500 texts and 200 texts and testing. For human prompts, we sample 50,000 texts (along with their prompts) and 10,000 and testing. 3.4 Adversarial Texts Our adversarial texts are texts from continued pre-trained (CPT) Llama 3.2 1B (Instruct) models. Creating these texts required two steps: further pre-training the 1B model and prompting the fine-tuned model. selected the 3.2 1B Instruct model its popularity and small size relative to other LLMs. This an ideal candidate for potential adversaries to train or fine-tune fully. Also, SLMs (Small Language Models) have not been explored as deeply terms text detection as their LLM counterparts. 14 --- Page 15 A PREPRINT Generate the original human writing have inspired the following essay.

Figure 3: Mirror prompting strategy used to generate essay prompts. 3.4.1 Continued Pre-training We continue pre-training 1B models using texts from a selected domain. We performed quality checks on texts using the TextDescriptives library [87]. The quality checks are designed using metrics researchers at Google use to pre-train language models [88] [89]. There are types of metrics: heuristic (e.g., number of stop words, out-of-vocabulary ratio, etc.) and repetitious (e.g., duplicate lines, duplicate n-gram character fraction, etc.). We used human texts that passed both sets of metrics for CPT. report the final numbers of filtered human texts by split and domain in Table 4. Table 4: CPT corpora size across domains and splits. Domain Validation Testing Tweets [CREDIT_CARD] Reviews [CREDIT_CARD] Abstracts [CREDIT_CARD] News [CREDIT_CARD] Essays [CREDIT_CARD] Creative Writing [CREDIT_CARD] To prevent data leakage across splits, we pre-train 18 models, one for each and domain combination. This division also helps simulate real-world conditions better: it is unlikely that the attacker’s and defender’s pre-training corpora will be an exact match. We perform full-parameter pre-training using APOLLO-Mini optimizer variant. We train all eighteen models using identical parameters, except for the maximum length of each input to be used. For we used 128 tokens; reviews and abstracts had 256 tokens; remaining three domains had 512 tokens. We pre-train using Kaggle’s two T4 GPUs for models from the first three domains. We used one A100 GPU from Cambridge’s High Performance Computing (HPC) service for the last three domains’ models. 15 --- Page 16 A PREPRINT 3.4.2 Generation account for differences in text length and AIG texts, we observed the distribution of text lengths (by counting 3.2 1B tokens) in each domain and split combination for all human texts. Then, we took all possible text lengths between the 25th and 75th percentiles (inclusively) to exclude possible outliers. We then randomly from this clipped distribution, C, to get an individual text length T to “generate” for text. use a continuation prompt, in which the fine-tuned model is given the first H tokens from a human text and is expected to generate up to N tokens. Given T, where T ∼C, we set H = ⌊T/3⌋and N = T −H. The final text includes the tokens from the human text, followed by N tokens. [90] refers to this type of text as mixcase — text that contains both human and LLM text. They also demonstrate that mixcase texts pose a challenge for existing detectors. We selected a temperature of 1.1 and value of 1 during the generation process. Additionally, we set the top-k parameter to 100. This parameter restricts number candidate tokens during generation. use these parameters across all fine-tuned models, regardless of split and domain. We justify this decision as during our initial detection experiments against the MAGE classifier, observed that this particular set of generation parameters yielded low detection scores. It is fair to assume that both an attacker and a defender may arrive at similar results when scoping out weaknesses in existing detectors. To isolate the effects of fine-tuning against the mixcase effect, we compare CPT generations to the original 1B Instruct generations. We use the same prompts well as identical generation parameters. 16 --- Page 17 A PREPRINT 3.5 Final Dataset Statistics report the non-adversarial and adversarial statistics in Tables 5 and 6. We do not generate training and validation using the non-trained 1B Instruct model, as it serves as a comparison against our CPT models. Table 5: Non-adversarial distribution of DACTYL and domain.

Desklib, e5-LoRA, and Pangram showcased performance on the RAID test set [91] [92] [13] [6]. Desklib and e5-LoRA were trained the RAID dataset; Pangram is an enterprise-grade text detector, and not all 17 --- Page 18 A PREPRINT details are available publicly. DAIGT DeBERTa-V3-Large obtained seventh place (out of 4,358 teams) in Kaggle’s Detect AI-Generated Text (DAIGT) competition, which focused on essay detection [93] [94]. This particular DeBERTa-V3-large model is unique to its two-stage training: it initially involves training on around 500,000 texts from the SlimPajama corpus, followed by domain-adaptive fine-tuning specifically on AIG essays [93]. FakeSpot is on a massive corpus spanning 14 datasets, including additional supporting data from newer LLMs such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. Fakespot also includes training on the 2023 review corpus [95]. We evaluated the MAGE Longformer to its robustness on unseen domains and models [17]. Similar to Pangram, AICD is a commercial detector available from RapidAPI, but the model is available on HuggingFace[96] [97]. Unfortunately, the commercial nature of these models means that exact training details are unavailable. SuperAnnotate was selected as its model coverage includes four of the five LLM families used in developing DACTYL: GPT (OpenAI), Mistral, and Llama [98]. We list Binoculars as having 14 billion parameters as it uses two Falcon 7B models [27]. subsubsectionDACTYL Trained classifiers We train four models the DACTYL training split: BERT-tiny, TinyBERT, distilRoBERTa-base, and ModernBERT-base. We train each classifier for five epochs (as used by the MAGE classifier), only keeping the model with the best validation tpAUC [17]. use a learning rate of 2e-5 suggested by [99]. To speed up training, we use a larger batch size of 64. We use PyTorch’s BCELossWithLogits and the AdamW optimizer for our initial loss function and optimizer. BCELossWithLogits is numerically more stable than traditional cross-entropy loss followed by a sigmoid computation (done to rescale logits to 1) [100]. The AdamW optimizer’s decoupled weight decay increases generalization performance over the standard Adam optimizer [101]. For the DeBERTa-V3-large, we trained with the same parameters as the other four models but only for one epoch and a size of 16 due to GPU memory limitations, as we observed a steep drop-off in tpAUC in the second epoch (validation tpAUC went from 75 to 0). This performance hit suggests that the model overfits rapidly with just one epoch. According to technical documentation for LibAUC, pre-training classifier with cross-entropy followed by DXO can increase performance [10]. We take the “pre-trained” models (i.e., models trained using BCELossWithLogits), and further train those models using the tpAUC loss function. We reset the classification head’s parameters shown in the tutorials. Since this loss function requires each batch to have a positive (AIG) and negative (human) sample, use a controlled data sampler to ensure each batch has a fixed proportion of positive samples. For the first four models, set the proportion (sampling rate) equal to 0.5 with size of 64, oversampling the positive class. We reduce the learning rate to 1e-5 — decaying learning rate can help the model learn nuances in the training set better [102]. For DeBERTa-V3-large, since the model’s performance worsens, do not apply DXO to the cross-entropy pre-trained model; instead, we train DeBERTa-V3-large from scratch (i.e., no cross-entropy training beforehand). The learning rate and sampling rate are the same for the four smaller models, but the batch size is still 16. note that cross-entropy pre-training is not necessary for DXO, to the experiments conducted by Yuan et al., it does improve [10]. We refer to binary cross-entropy trained classifiers as BCE classifiers and those trained with tpAUC loss as DXO (deep X-risk optimized) classifiers. 4.2 Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Test Set For our DACTYL classifiers, we evaluate their generalization capability to text detection test sets. This additional evaluation determines if classifiers are “overfitting” to test set. Adversarially trained deep-learning models are prone to overfitting and struggle with unmodified examples [103]. We select the following data sources in constructing our OOD test set, with full statistics reported in Table 8. AuTexTification. The AuTexTification test set has 21,832 texts and includes two domains: Amazon reviews and news articles [104]. Given that DACTYL dataset has these two domains, we can determine our classifiers can generalize. [104] used the BLOOM family and older OpenAI models generate the AIG texts. BEEMO. The Benchmark of Expert-Edited Machine-generated Outputs (BEEMO) dataset addresses more recent gap AIG text detection, focusing on mixcase detection [105]. AIG texts are edited by humans, GPT-4o, or Llama 3.1 70B. Since BEEMO’s texts often blur the line AI and human, we use [105]’s binary classification formulation: only pure human texts are considered human; any other text should be labelled as AIG. This definition also means that a human-edited LLM-generated should be considered AIG. Since there are no clearly defined splits, we use all 19,683 texts. BEEMO evaluates how well classifiers can detect AIG text surrounded by human text. 18 --- Page 19 A PREPRINT MAGE. Spanning 27 LLMs and seven major domains, MAGE most exhaustive test sets the entire test set aggregated over all domains for 60,743 texts. This dataset represents an extreme robustness test for our DACTYL classifiers. DREsS and AIG-ASAP. Dataset for Rubric-based Essay Scoring (on English as a Foreign Language Writing) of the latest student essay datasets, released in 2024 [106]. The DREsS dataset consolidates existing AES (Automated Essay Scoring) human essay datasets. Additionally, it provides a new student essay (written in English) dataset from students in an undisclosed university in South Korea [107]. Since DREsS only includes human texts, we from the AIG-ASAP dataset [108]. This dataset contains AIG essays that have gone through adversarial perturbations, including paraphrasing, sentence substitution, and synonym substitution. AIG-ASAP uses the GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Vicuna 7B to generate their essays. The total size of the DREsS and AIG-ASAP is 9,078 texts. We included these datasets to mimic a possible real-world deployment for our classifiers — likely, the text distribution of DREsS/AIG-ASAP differs noticeably the Ivy Panda/ELLIPSE training set.

We set pAUC(β = 5%) and tpAUC(α = 50%, β = 5%). use a maximum FPR of 5% consistent with [6]. We set the minimum TPR at 50% to minimize non-zero tpAUC scores (AICD and MAGE are the only classifiers with tpAUC scores less than 10). Table 9: Mean scores the six domains for each pre-trained classifier. Classifier tpAUC(50%, 5%) pAUC(5%) AUC AP Pangram 76.31 93.18 95.99 95.97 Desklib 66.09 87.73 91.03 89.56 Fakespot 61.12 87.39 94.45 92.24 Binoculars 50.72 82.95 93.0 86.71 SuperAnnotate 43.56 78.99 89.69 83.02 DAIGT 24.99 74.76 81.92 77.12 e5-LoRA 20.73 72.41 87.44 76.82 MAGE 3.56 62.18 78.88 66.17 AICD 2.67 61.78 74.57 63.49 We highlight the lack of separation between the top classifiers terms of AUC: three of the top four classifiers have an AUC ≥93, but only one, Pangram, has a tpAUC ≥70. The next highest mean tpAUC, Desklib, is around 10 points less. Also, the mean tpAUC (and pAUC) scores are substantially smaller than the mean and AP scores. This discrepancy supports the notion that the and AP scores are “boosted” by performance in non-deployable regions (at high FPR regions). Not surprisingly, the classifiers struggled significantly on tweets with only Pangram having a non-zero tpAUC shown in Figure 4. contrast, the news category was considerably easier, with a mean tpAUC of 64.73, 10 points higher than the next easiest domain (creative writing, CW). The zero-shot Binoculars method is quite capable of outperforming various transformer-based classifiers. Binoculars is the only other classifier that outscored Pangram in one domain (student essays). However, this method struggles 19 --- Page 20 PREPRINT Figure 4: tpAUC scores domain and classifier. with shorter text domains: the tpAUC score is zero for tweets and reviews and less than 30 for abstracts. These indicate that perplexity (and cross-perplexity) are unreliable signals on shorter texts. Similarly to [37], we investigate if detection performance varies across LLMs, in Figure 5. The Gemini 1.5 and Llama families are the most challenging to detect: the highest mean tpAUC for any of these four models is 20 (Gemini 1.5 Flash). Five of the nine classifiers have a tpAUC score of 0 on the 1.5 Pro model. Detectors may struggle on Gemini 1.5 to their Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture — multiple smaller neural networks function as a unified network [109]. Gemini 1.5 might be activating smaller networks (rather than its entire network) for specific text generation tasks which could degrade detection. Llama 3.2’s difficulty might stem from its architecture needing to support vision tasks [73]. We also observe that larger LLMs tend to outscore their smaller counterparts the same family: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3.2 90B, and Mistral Large all have smaller mean tpAUC scores than Haiku, GPT-4o Mini, Flash, Llama 3.3 70B, and Mistral Small models, respectively. Using Binoculars performance as a proxy for perplexity, the larger LLMs typically seem to generate more unpredictable (and diverse) texts. Curiously, despite being of the newest (and largest) models launched, DeepSeek-V3 remains noticeably easy to detect: Pangram achieves the highest score of any (classifier, LLM) combination on DeepSeek-V3, with score of 94. The Llama family, where each model has less than 100 billion parameters, outperforms DeepSeek-V3 a considerable margin. DeepSeek-V3 is also the third-easiest model to detect of the 11 LLMs, only surpassed by GPT-4o mini (34) Mistral Small (31). We highlight this due to DeepSeek-V3’s massive size of 671 billion parameters, which suggests that model size not be the sole determining factor in determining which models are challenging to distinguish. This behavior of DeepSeek-V3 being “easy to detect” was confirmed by another commercial detector, Originality AI. They point out that newer tend to reduce their classifier accuracy upon release, but did not observe this trend with DeepSeek-V3 [110]. [110] suspects DeepSeek-V3 may have been trained on other LLMs, 20 --- Page 21 PREPRINT Figure 5: tpAUC(50%, 5%) scores by model and classifier. such as the OpenAI family. This training process might explain why several classifiers, such as Desklib (released in October 2024), have relatively high tpAUC scores, despite not being exposed to DeepSeek-V3 generations in their training process. [37] demonstrated that OpenAI family posed a greater challenge to detectors. However, the pre-trained classifiers tested did not struggle significantly against OpenAI LLMs. It is likely that, given the popularity and accessibility of GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, dataset developers use OpenAI-generated texts extensively, which means detectors are exposed more to those texts. 5.1.2 Binary Cross-Entropy vs tpAUC Loss For the DACTYL-trained classifiers, we observe fine-tuning with tpAUC loss function makes more noticeable improvements for larger models in Figure 6. BERT-tiny and TinyBERT had worse tpAUC(50%,5%) after training tpAUC loss function, while distilRoBERTa and ModernBERT-base had negligible gains. In contrast, DeBERTa-V3- large had a noticeable increase of more than 2 points. Similar to the pre-trained classifiers, DACTYL-trained classifiers struggled more on the shorter text domains such as tweets, reviews, and abstracts. The smaller such as BERT-Tiny, had a harder time on these domains. However, this is significantly than the pre-trained classifiers. As model size grows, tpAUC score grows more slowly: you can obtain score of 96.62 with a distilRoBERTa- base (82 million parameters), but only score of 96.86 with a DeBERTa-V3-large (434 million parameters). This slowdown in tpAUC score increase suggests the model’s capacity to learn the training data is being reached. We can confirm results by checking the AUC scores in Table 10. The scores are greater than ≥99.0, indicating that all models can easily distinguish AIG texts DACTYL test set (although their performance in the upper left region the ROC curve varies). 21 --- Page 22 PREPRINT Figure 6: tpAUC(50%, 5%) and classifier.

However, this means that the scores are not directly comparable the pre-trained classifiers’ scores due to different α values. We can still compare LLMs’ difficulty “rankings” the sets of classifiers. LLM difficulty somewhat agrees the pre-trained classifiers: GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-V3, Mistral Small are the easiest LLMs, while 1.5 Pro and 3.2 90B the most difficult for the DACTYL-trained classifiers. However, the trend of better/larger models being more difficult to detect the same family does not hold for one case: Claude 3.5 Haiku (mean tpAUC of 85.34) is to detect than Claude 3.5 Sonnet (94.84). This discrepancy confirms that having more parameters not guarantee a more “human” text. The negligible gap between Mistral Large (95.11) and Small (96.08) supports this somewhat. 22 --- Page 23 PREPRINT Figure 7: Mean tpAUC(80%, 5%) score of all 10 DACTYL trained classifiers by model. 5.1.3 Biases by Domain and Category This section looks at possible contributing factors within certain domains (e.g., for reviews, star ratings, for student essays, Ivy Panda vs ELLIPSE performance, etc.). We evaluate pre-trained classifiers by comparing mean 5%) scores across each factor. We look at the maximum 5%) score per factor for our DACTYL-trained classifiers. use the maximum scores, than the mean, for the classifiers as these classifiers have been exposed to these factors already; if, after training, the maximum score is still “low” across all classifiers, it indicates that particular factor is inherently problematic. We raise to 80% as explained in section 5.1.2. We examine four domains: reviews, abstracts, news, student essays. We exclude tweets because pre-trained classifiers performed poorly on them. Creative writing the only major domain without any notable factors within it. Reviews As suggested by [17], AIG reviews likely to be positive. Intuitively, we expect one-star AIG reviews to be harder detect than higher-star AIG reviews. We investigate if this potential discrepancy influences detection results by stratifying test set by star rating. Since four pre-trained classifiers had a tpAUC(50%, 5%) of 0 across all star ratings, we on pre-trained classifiers that had at least one non-zero tpAUC score, in Table 11. Two classifiers — Pangram and Fakespot — saw their tpAUC scores increase as star rating increases; Desklib follows this trend until four-star reviews and drops off for five-star reviews. Pre-trained classifiers struggled with one-star reviews significantly compared to other ratings. According to Table 12, DACTYL-trained classifiers also exhibited this behavior, as the highest tpAUC(80%, 5%) was 80.55 for one-star reviews while all other star ratings had scores ≥85. 23 --- Page 24 PREPRINT Table 11: 5%) by review star for pre-trained classifiers. values indicate the highest scores for a star rating.

Independent sellers have already weaponized fake (human) one-star reviews COVID-19 pandemic to damage rivals’ reputations [111]. The fact that detectors struggle with these fake negative reviews may amplify the problem in online marketplaces, hurting sellers (and indirectly, consumers).

Conversely, AIG astrophysics abstracts are generally easier to distinguish from their human-written counterparts. Mathematical abstracts may likely have LATEX commands in their text, which can degrade detection, as most AIG texts would not have these commands. DACTYL-trained do appear to struggle as much on mathematical abstracts, as the only math subject that placed in top five was number theory (Table 14). Astrophysics abstracts remain easy to detect, with the bottom four subjects belonging to that category. Note DXO classifiers achieve highest tpAUC scores in all but one category.

Stratifying by news topics exhibited similar behavior (Figure 8). However, US category was noticeably easier detect, tpAUC score nearly 13 next easiest topic (Middle East news). The lack of difficulty for US news topic be more indicative of training set bias rather than an inherent issue for specific topics. DACTYL-trained classifiers achieved perfect 5%) in all topics except for Politics (99.96 by DeBERTa-V3-large DXO and BCE) and Political News (98.86 by ModernBERT-base DXO and BCE and distilRoBERTa-base DXO and BCE). The country of the news outlet style in the instruction prompt appears to influence detection slightly. We exclude MAGE and AICD as they achieved tpAUC scores across all news outlets. The pre-trained classifiers’ 5%) scores for the news outlets ranged from 81 to 86. The UK news outlets have a lower mean score, ranging from 81.65 to 82.90, while US have a slightly higher range, from 83.89 to 85.5. This gap is likely due to the UK news style using British spelling conventions, an attack to as an alternative spelling attack in the RAID dataset [6]. The Desklib and Fakespot classifiers, trained on RAID, do not suffer from performance drops when switching between and UK news outlets. However, SuperAnnotate and e5-LoRA, trained on subsets of RAID, show apparent differences the two groups. not observe a similar effect DACTYL-trained classifiers. DeBERTa-V3-large (DXO) obtained the “lowest” maximum tpAUC(80%,5%) of any of news outlets (99.93 for Daily Telegraph UK). All other news outlets least one classifier achieve a perfect tpAUC score. 25 --- Page 26 PREPRINT Figure 8: scores by news topic pre-trained classifiers. Student Essays evaluate the two subsets of Ivy Panda and ELLIPSE. ELLIPSE has two categories of interest: human essays written by English language learners and AIG essays generated in style of those learners. investigate if classifiers are biased toward this “ELL class.” We evaluate four possible combinations of Panda and ELLIPSE texts (results in 10): • ELLIPSE Human + ELLIPSE AI Human + Ivy Panda AI • Ivy Panda ELLIPSE AI ELLIPSE AIG essays were noticeably difficult: tpAUC scores were below 50. Ivy Panda AIG essays are easy to distinguish, tpAUC of at least 58. Multiple had tpAUC greater than 99 in test combinations involving those AIG essays. Fortunately, this weakness can be trained against, based on Table 16. The ELLIPSE texts are still slightly difficult to detect, but the gap is relatively small, even at a higher TPR. 5.2 Adversarial Results We explore whether our CPT (continued pre-trained) models can evade detection better than the base 3.2 1B instruct model can pre-trained classifiers. Then, we evaluate DACTYL-trained by comparing the performance of and BCE the same from the non-adversarial test set for evaluation. 26 --- Page 27 PREPRINT Figure 9: by outlet style classifiers.

However, there were still some zero tpAUC scores (SuperAnnotate not have non-zero tpAUC in any domain/model combination), so use the ranking system in section 2.5: rank first by tpAUC, followed by pAUC, AUC, and finally AP score. For pAUC, also FPR of 30% for a consistent β value. We determine if the CPT model was detect the base model in a particular domain if it maintained a lower tpAUC score (followed by tie-breakers if needed in the other three metrics). example, in Table 17, CPT model for reviews has a much lower tpAUC (33.54) base for reviews (44.5).

CPT models excelled at the three text domains (tweets, reviews, and abstracts), degrading performance compared to model for all nine classifiers. CPT models outperformed the base models for six classifiers in the news and essays domains. However, model creative writing struggled against the base model, with only three classifiers performing worse on the CPT model’s generations. 28 --- Page 29 PREPRINT Table 18: CPT vs base model results on pre-trained classifiers. ✓indicates that harder to detect; ✗ indicates base model was harder.

We compare scores across domain and classifier type (BCE vs DXO) in Figure 11, similar to Figure 6. We exclude 1B Instruct texts. Note that mean score is just under 75, a relatively high gap to the 90+ tpAUC scores we saw for the non-adversarial results. However, some classifiers performed strongly on some domains: DeBERTa-V3-large (DXO) achieved a 99.07 tpAUC score CPT news model, suggesting potential to defend against an unseen fine-tuned/CPT model. DXO classifiers had mixed results compared to their BCE peers. the DeBERTa-V3-large, TinyBERT, and BERT-tiny, loss function improved their tpAUC scores (although for the smaller classifiers, the gains were more modest). ModernBERT and distilRoBERTa saw a decrease in their scores loss function. The DXO classifiers that scored less test set showed improvements the CPT test set. Conversely, classifiers that test set CPT test set than their BCE counterparts. results indicate a possible trade-off between performance on adversarial and non-adversarial sets. This phenomenon has been well documented in the literature, to as the robustness-accuracy trade-off [112]. However, this phenomenon does not apply to DeBERTa-V3-large (DXO) — it the only classifier to show improvements on both and adversarial tests over the BCE-trained version. We suspect the discrepancy might be to the larger model size and more parameters improves generalization. 5.3 Evaluating on the OOD Test Set pre-trained classifiers’ struggles test set, investigate if DACTYL-trained classifiers struggle the test set using tpAUC(40%, 30%) scores, in Table 19. For reference, we include test set (excluding the generations from the (non-CPT) 3.2 1B Instruct). For all sub-test sets, we compute the scores on that entire subset (i.e., no averaging by domain).

There are three main observations: (1) as classifier grows, tpAUC score increases; (2) DXO classifiers have slightly better generalizability their BCE peers (except for distilRoBERTa-base); (3) classifier trained on one domain may not generalize to other texts the same domain (see the low on the AuTexTification subset). The first observation highlights a vital scaling property — ideally, larger classifiers should generalize better [113]. This trend suggests that as a model’s parameters increase, they should learn better representations of the data (i.e., do not just memorize patterns). That is the case DACTYL-trained classifiers, at least based on mean tpAUC score. However, individual subsets, such as AuTexTification and MAGE, appear to follow this scaling law. This gap can due to DACTYL containing only one-shot/few-shot text generation and mixcase examples, which might not translate well to zero-shot generations. The increased performance on and AIG-ASAP due to similarities between ELLIPSE and Ivy Panda, as ELLIPSE and DREsS contain ELL texts. The second observation indicates the general advantage of DXO. The results support the claim that optimizing tpAUC directly, rather than using binary cross-entropy as a proxy, can lead to better performance and even generalization. For the lone exception, distilRoBERTa-base, suspect that our training parameters might not be effective; we might be able obtain a higher tpAUC score with some tuning, as [10]’s experiments involved hyperparameter tuning. The last observation seems to be an example of robustness-accuracy trade-off we saw in section 5.2.2. The AuTexTification dataset contains no adversarial attacks or challenging texts — texts are generated via a continuation prompt similar to some of MAGE’s texts (although MAGE includes some paraphrased texts as adversarial texts)[104] [17]. contrast, AIG-ASAP dataset contains adversarially modified AIG texts. Yet, to a certain extent, most classifiers do better on the DREsS/AIG-ASAP subset (and even BEEMO) than the former two. We attribute this performance difference to the adversarial nature of BEEMO and AIG-ASAP. 30 --- Page 31 A PREPRINT 5.4 Deployment Scenario — Student Essays While four X-risks (tpAUC, AUC, and AP) often give a general idea of classifier performance, these metrics summarize performance over a range of thresholds. When classifiers are in real-world settings, decision-makers often want to see a classifier’s performance given a fixed threshold. We simulate a deployment of two DACTYL-trained classifiers for detecting AIG student essays — ModernBERT-base BCE (MB-BCE) and DeBERTa-V3-large DXO (DV3L-DXO). For our “real-world” set, use the DAA subset (DREsS/AIG-ASAP). This selection for our test set offers a more pessimistic view of our classifiers. We selected MB-BCE as it the highest tpAUC(50%,5%) among all the non-adversarial student essays domain. DV3L-DXO was DXO classifier overall the adversarial set for student essays. 5.4.1 Threshold Selection We evaluate two possible cases for threshold selection using either the ROC or PRC curves. We rescale our thresholds 0 to 1 to 0 to 100, as some determined thresholds were small. We list how we decide each threshold for each case. For consistency, positive sample is an AIG essay, and negative sample is a human-written essay. Regardless of which curve is selected, most educators interested in minimizing false positives — students wrongly accused using AI [1]. Therefore, focus on selecting desirable levels for each curve using FPR (ROC) or precision (PRC). FPR and precision rely on minimizing false positives, but they approach them differently. FPR evaluates number of false positives relative to the total number of negative samples. Precision measures relative to all samples flagged as positive. We determine our thresholds using student essay test set. Making a threshold on the “test set” is reasonable, as we access to our labels (as most AIG text developers should). However, we cannot make using the DAA test set, unlikely that both educators and developers would access to real-world labels. ROC Individual points on ROC curve map to individual TPR@FPR values. As mentioned, ROC curve contains TPR@FPR values with no viability in a real-world setting (such as TPR@FPR=100%). To determine the threshold using ROC curve, we select maximum FPR β and calculate the threshold with the FPR that is closest (but less than) to β [114]. PRC For the PRC, we set a minimum precision pr and choose with the highest recall (TPR) ≥pr. use PyTorch’s torcheval library to the threshold for a fixed precision[115]. 5.4.2 Results by Threshold We report four calculated thresholds by classifier: TPR@FPR=5% [6], TPR@FPR=1%[114], recall@precision=95%, and recall@precision=99% in Table 20. We include a fifth fixed threshold of 50 (0.5) as a baseline. that the MB-BCE classifier generally has higher scores across all metrics. The MB-BCE is confident in its predictions of human texts, judging by the low thresholds. The DV3L-DXO is more cautious in its threshold selection, with relatively high threshold at 95.11 for recall@precision=99%.

However, this FPR is still high in deployment: for example, Vanderbilt University submitted over 75,000 (human) essays to Turnitin in 2022 [5]. Ultimately, if we used this threshold (TPR@FPR=5% for DV3L-DXO), we could expect around 11,708 false positives. Using a lower acceptable FPR of 1% reduces the DAA FPR to just under 3%. Setting a higher precision of 99% also works: the FPR is down to 0.66% and the TPR is at a respectable 84.16%. The threshold selection process also showcases trade-off between catching more texts and avoiding false positives. A higher threshold naturally reduces FPR, but expense of TPR — you likely to miss actual AIG texts. We emphasize that threshold selection is highly domain-dependent. In our deployment scenario, minimizing false positives. Thus, we are more inclined to pick a higher threshold. However, for Amazon reviews, the cost of letting an AIG review through (such as a fake one-star review) could damage a seller’s reputation and a consumer’s trust. Likewise, a developer training an LLM may accept a high FPR to avoid an LLM on AIG texts. This deployment scenario also underscores the dangers of test set and not properly evaluating generalizability. One might naively opt to deploy MB-BCE classifier solely because it on the essays domain. As we can see, the classifier overfits significantly on DACTYL and may be learning superficial features AIG and human texts. The DXO classifier does not showcase this behavior. 6 Conclusion 6.1 Limitations While our analysis of our datasets and detectors intends to be exhaustive, we mention some limitations. First, our dataset only includes one-shot/few-shot examples (excluding CPT continuation generations) but does not include more traditional zero-shot generated texts. However, we did so as most literature includes mostly zero-shot generations, so we addressed this gap via our dataset. Given the classifiers’ lack of generalizability to the MAGE and AuTexTification datasets, suspect that learning on few-shot generations may not translate directly zero-shot generations. Our dataset only focuses on English texts, but we caution that texts in other languages might yield novel problems. We also out that we selected training parameters based on prior experiments; it is likely that with further hyperparameter tuning, of DXO classifiers can outperform their BCE counterparts [10]. For our simulated deployment, we did not quantitatively factor in the costs false positives and negatives for simplicity. In some real-world settings, we access to such details (e.g., time/money spent on falsely accusing a student of using an LLM), which could affect the threshold identification process. Also, not include additional factors that could boost detection; for example, fake news articles often spread faster than news articles [116]. Including metrics as number of shares in a fixed timeframe could help better discern and AIG articles. Finally, detectors are imperfect, and decision-makers (such as educators) should carefully weigh context before deciding whether text is AIG. While the end goal is to build a robust detector that does not need a “human-in-the-loop”, the current detectors are not fully ready. 6.2 Summary We provide an intensive analysis of text detector. We highlight inconsistencies AIG text evaluation on the X-risk binary classification measures: tpAUC, AUC, and AP. We then construct the large-scale one-shot/few-shot DACTYL covering six highly domains. texts from full-parameter 32 --- Page 33 A PREPRINT CPT 1B Instruct models. Existing detectors struggle our dataset, suggesting that generalizability is not guaranteed. CPT-generated texts also evade detectors better than non-CPT generations of the same model. also observe several vulnerabilities in several domains: AIG one-star reviews are harder to detect, news articles written style of news outlets lead to some degradation, AIG essays style of ELL students also evade detection. Fortunately, we demonstrate that DACTYL-trained classifiers can close the gap in these vulnerabilities. We out that CPT generations still seem challenging detect, but DACTYL-trained classifiers perform much the pre-trained ones. However, we note that classifiers binary cross-entropy seem to the test set, while DXO classifiers tend to generalize to unseen texts better. We confirm this trend by evaluating a deployment scenario the DAA dataset between cross-entropy trained ModernBERT-base and the tpAUC-optimized DeBERTa-V3-large classifiers. While text detection seems daunting, with newer LLMs and attacks released monthly, we observe some evidence of generalizability in existing For example, multiple classifiers had little trouble with DeepSeek-V3 despite being more recent LLM. We also want to highlight Pangram, the only pre-trained classifier to achieve tpAUC(50%, 5%) greater than 70 the DACTYL non-adversarial test set. Pangram’s success indicates that it is possible a robust classifier. 6.3 Future Work DACTYL is certainly not meant to be a finalized dataset — text detection and evasion continue to evolve rapidly. This development speed necessitates continuous updates to text datasets to avoid severe distributional shifts between training and real-world texts. Future work for “DACTYL 2.0” might explore full-parameter instruction tuning, rather than just continued pre-training. We also recommend exploring LLM fine-tuning as multiple LLM providers have convenient (but costly) fine-tuning APIs. The six domains are just a few of several impacted domains. AIG code is now a new concern — a Georgetown University study demonstrated that several LLMs’ generated code contains security vulnerabilities [117]. Workflows such as GitHub pull requests, a process of merging code from different branches in a repository, could use text detection to flag LLM-generated code for further inspection. Wikipedia is also facing concerns of AIG articles, with an estimated 5% (in August 2024) of English articles generated by LLMs [118]. [118] argue that these articles are typically low-quality. Besides including more data, modifications to the classifier could show improvements in robustness. Kolmogorov- Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated improvements over traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [119]. Exploring advancements in architecture (such as ModernBERT) is essential to improving classification performance. As with many security frontiers in technology, is an arms race involving multiple defenders from academia, governments, industry, and various individual and organized attackers. Many traditional machine-learning techniques that saw success in text classification tasks not translate into text detection. We encourage future researchers (and detector developers) to thoroughly inspect their machine-learning processes and classifiers. We expect adversaries to do the same. By discovering their own classifiers’ vulnerabilities and limitations before launching them, defenders can stay ahead in the race.

Please cite the final published version. Abstract—Online services often require users to agree to lengthy and obscure Terms of Service (ToS), leading to informa- tion asymmetry and legal risks. This paper proposes TOSense—a Chrome extension that allows users to ask questions about ToS in natural language and get concise answers in real time. The system combines (i) a crawler “tos-crawl” that automatically extracts ToS content, and (ii) a lightweight large language model pipeline: MiniLM for semantic retrieval and BART-encoder for answer relevance verification. To avoid expensive manual annotation, we present a novel Question Answering Evaluation Pipeline (QEP) that generates synthetic questions and verifies the correctness of answers using clustered topic matching. Experiments on five major platforms, Apple, Google, X (formerly Twitter), Microsoft, and Netflix, show the effectiveness of TOSense (with up to 44.5% accuracy) across varying number of topic clusters. During the demonstration, we will showcase TOSense in action. Attendees will be able to experience seamless extraction, interactive question answering, and instant indexing of new sites.

INTRODUCTION Online services generally users to accept of Service (ToS) (including End User License Agreement (EULA) and Privacy Policy) before use. These ToS describe the rights and obligations between the platform and users, but are often lengthy and frequently use legal jargons [1], [2], making them inaccessible to most users. McDonald and Cranor [2] estimated that if American netizens were to read all such encountered policies, it would cost 201 hours annually (∼$781 billion worth of lost productivity). Empirical studies show that the vast majority of users accept ToS without meaningful review, 86% spent less than one minute reading, and 93% accepted it despite the inclusion of intentionally unreasonable clauses [3]. This “default consent” phenomenon causes users to unknowingly accept legally binding terms such as ultimate ownership of the account, automatic renewal, and unilateral removal of posted content. To address this problem, a variety of systems have attempted to improve the accessibility and transparency of ToS [4], [5]. Most of these systems rely on recent developments in Large Language Models (LLM) to let users interactively understand ToS [1], [5], [6]. However, to the best of our knowledge, almost all of the current systems suffer from several limitations: (A) Limited Coverage: Many systems are limited to either predefined platforms [4] or predefined topics (for example, mainly limited to privacy/security [1], [6]). BART (Summarizer) MiniLM (Text encoder) Readability Puppeteer UI BL Cloud ToS Link Popular ToS Encodings Text Encodings 𝜃𝑠𝑖𝑚 Processing BART 𝜏≥0.3 Ans not found No Yes 𝑎: Answer 𝑞: User Question Is platform indexed? YES NO If Indexed Crawling Queue Store Encodings Fig. 1. System architecture of TOSense (B) Ineffectiveness: These systems often make impractical assumptions regarding document structure and the level of user engagement, rendering them ineffective for practical scenarios. For example, Claudette requires its users to manually paste ToS content on a separate portal everytime they encounter a ToS [5]. Another key limitation is to assume that ToS have a single-page structure that makes it difficult to handle complex organization of clauses linked across multiple pages. (C) Lack of Comprehensive Evaluations: Due to the absence of suitable benchmarks, it is significantly challenging to evaluate the reliability of such systems [6]. To address these challenges, we present Chrome extension combined with the LLM pipeline to help users interactively read and understand ToS—along with a Question/Answer Pipeline (QEP) to quantify reliability of TOSense without relying on labor-intensive man- ual annotations of ToS. Our novel contributions are: • We implement tos-crawl, a crawler that supports automatic identification and extraction of multi-page ToS content. It supports features such as language filtering, login redirection avoidance and version deduplication. • We a novel Pipeline (QEP) specifically suited for ToS that employs T5 ques- tion generator model along with a clustering algorithm quantify the question answering capability relying on manually curated datasets. II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW AND ARCHITECTURE TOSense comprises three layers: the Cloud Layer, the Back- end Layer, and the User Interface. These layers are illustrated in Fig. 1 and are detailed below. A) The Cloud Layer: The cloud layer of TOSense is its main computational unit. Cloud layer hosts two LLMs as a service: MiniLM and BART [7]. TOSense uses MiniLM to arXiv:2508.00659v1 [cs.CR] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- encode textual input into feature vectors as shown in Fig. 1. When a user query is received, TOSense asks MiniLM to first encode the user query and then uses cosine similarity (denoted by θsim in Fig. 1) to retrieve an answer from the ToS that shows the highest cosine similarity with the encoded query. The aforementioned pipeline would output an answer irrespective of whether or not query is relevant to the ToS. To address such a case, TOSense performs a hypothesis test on the query and the identified answer using BART. BART outputs a number b ∈[0, 1] quantifying the relevance between and the answer. If b < τ TOSense responds with a predefined statement that it was unable to find an appropriate answer for the user query, and simply prints the answer if b ≥τ. We heuristically set τ = 0.3 as it worked best for our experiments. Maintaining Popular ToS Base: To ensure freshness and ef- ficiency, the cloud layer periodically appends the ToS links of previously indexed platforms to the backend crawling queue, automatically triggering the re-crawl process. The updated documents are passed through the MiniLM encoder, and stored back to the ToS Encodings (see Fig. 1). When users visit these indexed platforms, the system can directly retrieve the pre-processed encodings results to perform semantic search and question-answering without real-time crawling, greatly reducing response latency. B) The Backend Layer: The backend layer performs server- side crawling extraction of ToS. It maintains a crawl- ing task queue, which contains the platform records to be processed. A separate worker process continuously polls the queue and automatically calls the crawler module to process the platforms in the task. The crawler module is implemented based on the Puppeteer framework, augmented with the Stealth plug-in to circumvent anti-crawling mechanisms, and supports simulating user behaviors, such as automatically scrolling pages, expanding hidden content, and skipping login redirects. The module has recursive link tracking capabilities, can iden- tify and extract clause-related subpages, and filter out the latest versions based on built-in rules. After the page is loaded, the content will be cleaned through the Mozilla Readability algorithm and converted to Markdown format, and finally sent to cloud layer together with metadata for semantic encoding and index updates. C) The User Interface (UI) Layer: The UI layer is the main interactive entry point for users and is implemented as a Chrome browser extension on the Plasmo framework. a user visits any website, the extension will first detect whether the platform has been indexed by the system. If it has been indexed, the extension notifies the user via a sidebar popup and support direct Q&A interaction on the preprocessed ToS content. If the current platform has not extension will automatically analyze the page content to detect potential links related to ToS. When such links are detected, the extension prompts the user with the option to add the platform to the crawling queue. Upon confirmation, the link is appended the crawling queue and will be indexed in the future.

III. EVALUATION As discussed previously, the lack of benchmarks presents a major challenge towards comprehensively evaluating the performance of Question/Answer (QA) models for ToS. In this section, we first a novel QA (QEP) that addresses this challenge and then report results of our evaluation on 5 popular ToS platforms. Evaluation Methodology: Formally, we denote TOSense as T that takes as inputs a ToS D with a question q and returns the answer a = T (q|D) ∈D. Our objective is to tell or not a correctly answers q relying on a curated dataset. QEP achieves this in the following steps: (Step 1): QEP maintains a set of ToS (see step 1 in Fig. 2) from popular platforms such as Facebook and Google. In the preparation phase, QEP first encodes statements of these ToS feature vectors by processing them the MiniLM QA model. These feature vectors represent the semantics of each statement of ToS. QEP then uses the k-means clustering algorithm C to group these feature vectors into k clusters (step 2 in Fig. 2). The intuition behind the clustering is that each of these k learned clusters would represent a unique topic. (Step 2): In the application phase, given a ToS D, QEP first assigns each statement di ∈D to one of the k previously iden- tified clusters (see step 3 Fig. 2). QEP then employs a T5- based automated question generator1 Q to generate a question for each statement (step 4). Formally, qi = Q(di), ∀di ∈D. (Step 3): Given D and qi, QEP invokes TOSense T to identify the answer ai = T (qi|D) from D. To check or not ai correctly answers qi, QEP compares the clustering labels of ai and di (steps 5 and 6 Fig. 2). If C(ai) = C(di)—i.e., the answer identified by TOSense is assigned the same cluster as the statement used to generate qi in step 4 of Fig. 2—QEP marks the answer to be correct. 1Huggingface token: iarfmoose/t5-base-question-generator --- Page 3 --- TABLE II TOPIC DISTRIBUTION IN TOS DOCUMENTS FIVE SELECTED PLATFORMS Platform Topics Third-Party Proprietary Privacy Legally Security Services Rights Binding Apple 0.13 0.26 0.18 0.24 0.19 Google 0.15 0.30 0.18 0.16 0.21 X 0.11 0.24 0.09 0.42 0.14 Microsoft 0.28 0.30 0.11 0.16 0.15 Netflix 0.13 0.33 0.11 0.19 0.24 Results: We maintain of ToS from 15 different platforms—Adobe, Apple, Coursera, Dropbox, Epic Games, Facebook, GitHub, Google, Instagram, OpenAI, Quora, Red- dit, Stream, TikTok and X. ToS of these plat- forms are in the QEP preparation phase (see Fig. 2) to train the clustering algorithm. For this experiment, we use k ∈{5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 80} and report results in Table I. We observe that as k increases, the accuracy of TOSense drops slightly. This is expected as increasing k also increases the number of output clusters to which ai might be assigned, leading to a slight decrease in accuracy. However surprisingly this decrease is not as sharp as one might expect. For example, the drop in accuracy is 2.5% for Apple and 7% for Google Table I. This shows that TOSense gives a fairly stable performance under multiple evaluation setups of QEP. We also compare the distribution of topics in ToS of multiple platforms. To achieve this, we manually assign a topic to each of the identified clusters in step 2 of Fig. 2 by analyzing the statements grouped into each cluster. We then report the total number of statements from each ToS assigned to each topic (or cluster) in Table II. We observe a similarity in the proportion of topics discussed by all 5 platforms with a few exceptions. For example, we observe that X focuses notably more frequently on legally binding end-users to the ToS and relatively less frequently on privacy and security aspects as compared to other platforms. In contrary, Netflix focuses most frequently on the proprietary ownership of its contents other platforms. IV. SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION To evaluate the availability and operational efficiency of the TOSense system under actual deployment conditions, we deployed the complete system on a lightweight virtual machine running Ubuntu 24.04, which was allocated 2 virtual CPU cores (Intel Xeon E5-2683 v4) and 8GB of RAM, with no GPU acceleration. We then selected the same five represen- tative platforms as Table I, assuming these platforms were indexed, and sentence-level embeddings were pre-generated and cached in the system’s ToS database. This setup simulates a typical stable state in a real-world deployment, where the query phase involves only retrieval and answer generation, without any regeneration of embeddings. For each platform, we executed five equivalent query re- quests using the question “Does this service share my data TABLE III RUNTIME PERFORMANCE OF TOSENSE ON PLATFORMS. Platform Latency (s) CPU (%) RAM (%) Timing (s) Apple 2.15 91.84 35.42 2.080 Google 2.14 92.24 35.10 2.030 X 1.76 91.38 35.10 1.674 Microsoft 2.99 93.34 37.78 2.917 Netflix 2.10 92.90 37.10 2.040 with third parties?” and recorded the following three metrics: • Latency: The total time from client request to response, used to assess user-perceived responsiveness. • Resource Usage (CPU and Memory): System-level CPU and memory usage, recorded using the psutil tool, immediately after each query. • Timing: The actual execution time within the server, encompassing only the and answer verification phases (MiniLM + BART). The results show that even without using a GPU, TOSense system can still keep query response latency below 3 seconds on all five platforms. CPU utilization for each query remained stable between 91% and 93% and memory usage remained below 38% across all platforms, demonstrating good resource stability. V. WHAT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED will showcase the complete workflow of TOSense in different usage scenarios with the attendees, and show how it can help users understand complex ToS content and identify potential risks. We acknowledge that no attendees’ identity information will be collected during the demonstration, and all interactions will be completed anonymously. In contrast to conventional LLM-based tools, such as ChatGPT, which rely on manual copy-paste of relevant documents, TOSense provides an automatic, end-to-end ToS understanding solution that covers the entire pipeline from document extraction to semantic question answering. Atten- dees to experience the following core functional- ities: • Install the Plugin and Trigger Platform Detection: the demonstration, attendees able to download and load the TOSense Chrome extension into their local Chrome browser. As they browse will automatically determine has been indexed: If it has, it enters interactive Q&A mode; otherwise, it will first analyze whether the current page contains potential ToS related links. If a suitable link is detected, it the user to queue the platform for crawling. • Query ToS and Receive Semantic Answers: For the indexed platform, attendees can issue natural language questions, such as: “Can I permanently delete my ac- count and data?”, “What personal data does this platform collect?” through the extension. The system will retrieve relevant content from the platform’s ToS and display the --- Page 4 --- answer after relevance verification; if no suitable answer is found, the system will explicitly notify the user that no valid answer could be found within the document to avoid misleading. • Observe Automated Crawling and Document Process- ing: When a previously unindexed platform is submitted for processing, the tos-crawl module is triggered to recursively follow identified ToS-related links. At- tendees will observe how it simulates user interactions such as auto-scrolling, expanding collapsible sections, and bypassing login prompts to extract content. For content that spread across multiple pages, the module automatically cleans the content, deduplicates versions, and consolidates the structure, ultimately generating a unified Markdown document for downstream semantic encoding. This processed result is cached, so that visits to same platform can skip crawling and enable immediate interaction. Fig. 3 illustrates the TOSense plugin answering a user’s query about personal data collection, on the extracted ToS content. Fig. 3. TOSense plugin interface responding to a personal data query on an indexed platform. VI. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK Although TOSense provides a usable prototype and demon- strates the feasibility of intelligent interpretation of ToS based on LLM, this is only the first step towards comprehensive understanding. The following limitations remain, suggesting concrete directions for future improvement. (1) Crawler Robustness: The current crawler uses basic such as automatic scrolling and click-to-expand, as well as fixed keywords (such as “terms”, “privacy”, “policy”, etc.) and heuristic rules to filter links. For ToS pages that use single-page application routing, asynchronous API loading, or use unconventional URL naming, this approach is prone to missing or only crawling part of the content. In the future, we plan to integrate lightweight computer vision techniques to detect related components and adopt semantic matching using pre-trained language models to identify likely ToS links. (2) Lack of User-Centred Evaluation: Currently, no sys- tematic user research has been conducted to evaluate whether TOSense can improve users’ understanding of terms or change “default consent” behavior in the long term. The actual utility still needs further empirical exploration, plan to conduct A/B testing and task-based comprehension studies, focusing on factors such as answer usefulness and behavioral changes (such as click-through rate, summary reading time, etc.) to verify user benefits in real browsing scenarios. (3) Answer Accuracy and Model Limitations: The current system has achieved a maximum accuracy of 44.5% on the Microsoft ToS dataset (Table I). While this demonstrates feasibility of the system’s question-answering capabilities, it also highlights the limitations of using lightweight language models (such as MiniLM and BART) and answer relevance in the context of ToS. For the future work, plan to explore instruction-tuned models that better follow natural language queries, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using large-scale corpora of ToS documents to enhance the model’s understanding of ToS-specific structure and terminology. VII. CONCLUSION In this paper extension that combines a ToS crawler with the MiniLM + BART-encoder LLM pipeline—that answers user queries about ToS contents real time. We also propose a novel pipeline to quantitatively evaluate TOSense without manual annotation. on five selected platforms show that TOSense maintains a stable accuracy rate at different clustering hyperparameters. able to observe TOSense’s core interaction flow and experience the system hands-on. The adaptability of the crawler and user research still need to be improved, but TOSense has laid a reproducible technical foundation for improving the transparency of le- gal texts and promoting user informed consent.

This has catalyzed a shift from single- step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reason- ing. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a tax- onomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engi- neering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, educa- tion, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual in- terpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 sem- inal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining fu- ture directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI. 1 Introduction The emergence Models (LLMs) has catalyzed remarkable progress in the medi- cal domain, with specialized models like Med- PaLM (Singhal et al., 2025), PMC-LLaMA (Wu et al., 2023), and BioGPT (Luo et al., 2022) demon- strating significant capabilities. However, these models, which often generate answers directly, struggle with the complex, multi-step inference * Wenxuan Wang and Zizhan Ma equally contribute to this paper. † Wenting Chen is the corresponding author. crucial for high-stakes clinical decision-making. The process of medical diagnosis is not one of simple pattern matching but of deep, causal rea- soning, where clinicians synthesize symptoms, pa- tient history, and test results to form a coherent explanation (Richens et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2024). Diagnostic errors, a leading cause of medical mal- practice claims, underscore the profound risks of inadequate reasoning (Schaffer et al., 2017). This critical need has spurred research into rea- soning LLMs. Inspired by breakthroughs like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei al., 2023), which elicits intermediate inferential steps, the field is developing models that can simulate clinical workflows, justify conclusions, and adapt to complex diagnostic challenges. These models are not only vital for decision support but also as educational tools, where AI-driven structured feed- back has been shown to significantly enhance stu- dents’ clinical skills (Brügge al., 2024). This paper presents emerging field. To ensure a comprehen- sive analysis, we conducted a structured literature search across major academic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and arXiv, for papers published between 2022 and 2025. Using keywords such as "LLM," "medical reasoning," "clinical reasoning," and "complex medical tasks," our initial query yielded over 200 articles. These were screened by title and abstract, followed by a full-text review for relevance to explicit reasoning mechanisms. This process resulted in a final corpus of 60 core studies that form the basis of our review. The remainder of this paper is structured to guide the reader from fundamental concepts to future challenges. Section 3 examines how reasoning tech- niques are adapted different data modalities: text, image, and code. Section 4 presents our core contribution, a taxonomy of reasoning enhance- ment techniques organized into training-time and test-time strategies.

Finally, Section 7 discusses critical challenges and future research directions before we offer concluding remarks. 2 Background Medical reasoning, the cognitive process of syn- thesizing patient data to formulate diagnoses and treatment plans, is fundamental to medical prac- tice. While Models (LLMs) excel at processing medical text, their standard proba- bilistic architecture is not inherently suited for the structured, multi-step inference required in high- stakes clinical decision-making. This limitation has spurred development of specialized Rea- soning LLMs, which are architected to produce transparent, verifiable, and robust inferential path- ways, addressing a critical need for trustworthy AI in medicine (Savage et al., 2024; Kim al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025). 2.1 From Generalist LLMs to Specialized Reasoners Conventional LLMs, operating as probabilistic se- quence models, are proficient at knowledge re- trieval but often struggle with complex logical oper- ations, such as distinguishing correlation from cau- sation or managing uncertainty et al., 2023). A key breakthrough was Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which demonstrated that by instruct- ing a model to generate step-by-step reasoning, its latent inferential capabilities could be elicited, sig- nificantly improving performance on logical tasks et al., 2023; Nachane al., 2024). Building on this insight, the focus has shifted from prompting techniques to architecting mod- els where reasoning is a primary design objective. State-of-the-art models, such as OpenAI’s o1, now integrate supervised fine-tuning on explicit reason- ing traces and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to reward logically sound pro- cesses (OpenAI al., 2024; Pan et al., 2025b). Recent advances have demonstrated that structured clinical reasoning approaches significantly enhance 2 --- Page 3 --- diagnostic accuracy (Sonoda al., 2025). There- fore, Reasoning LLMs are defined not just by their performance but by their designed capacity for transparent inference—a critical feature for their safe application in high-stakes domains al., 2025). 2.2 The Imperative for Robust Reasoning in Medical Practice The need for robust LLM reasoning is particularly acute in medicine, where inferential quality directly impacts patient safety and outcomes. Diagnostic errors, often stemming from flawed clinical rea- soning, are cause of preventable harm, contributing to an estimated 31.8% practice claims, with a significant portion resulting in patient death al., 2017). Reasoning LLMs offer a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. In medical educa- tion, AI-driven tutors are already being used to im- prove students’ diagnostic and history-taking skills through structured feedback al., 2024). For practicing clinicians, these models can act as cognitive partners. For instance, recent systems can analyze diagnostic reasoning documented in electronic health records to provide real-time feed- back on potential cognitive biases or logical gaps (Schaye al., 2025). By augmenting clinical rea- soning in both training and practice, these advanced models represent a new frontier for improving the quality, safety, and consistency of patient care. 3 Medical Reasoning Under Various Modalities The data modality—whether text, image, or code—fundamentally shapes the medical reason- ing challenge. Consequently, the strategies to im- bue LLMs with reasoning capabilities are tailored to the unique constraints and affordances of each data type. This section analyzes how reasoning techniques adapted across these three primary modalities. 3.1 Reasoning over Text Textual data, found in clinical notes, dialogues, and medical literature, is information-dense but lacks inherent logical structure. The primary chal- lenge is guide the model’s generative process along a factually correct and clinically valid infer- ential path. Research has coalesced around three main strategies. First, to impose structure, models are trained to make their reasoning explicit. Tech- niques like explicit path generation guide models to produce step-by-step rationales, either by align- ing with clinical inference patterns al., 2024) or by grounding each step in a structured knowl- edge graph al., 2025). Second, to ensure the validity of these paths, researchers focus on enforcing logical consistency. This is achieved by incorporating formal methods like first-order logic (FOL) to verify claims (Zafar al., 2025) or by using reinforcement learning to reward factual cor- rectness and penalize hallucinations (Zhang et al., 2025a; Liu al., 2025b). Third, to move beyond single, linear paths, other work explores deepen- ing and broadening inference. This includes test- time scaling (TTS) to allocate more computation for deeper reasoning on a single problem (Huang al., 2025a; et al., 2025; Shi et al., 2024), and multi-agent systems that simulate collaborative de- bate or dialogue to explore diverse perspectives and build a more robust, explainable consensus (Hong al., 2024; Tang al., 2024; Zhu and Wu, 2025). 3.2 Reasoning over Image In medical imaging, the central challenge is bridg- ing the "modality gap" between low-level pixel data and high-level clinical concepts. Reasoning must be visually grounded to be trustworthy. The research landscape reflects a progression toward tighter integration of vision and language. An initial approach focuses on cross-modal align- ment, often learning to teach Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to associate vi- sual findings with correct diagnostic labels, reward- ing the model for making clinically sound con- nections (Pan al., 2025a; Lai al., 2025; Su al., 2025; Zhang al., 2025b). A more sophisti- cated strategy involves coordinating the reason- ing process between modalities. Frameworks like al., 2024b) and the two-phase paradigm of Elicit and Enhance (Mu al., 2025) es- tablish an "orchestrator-perceiver" dynamic, where a language model generates a high-level reasoning plan that explicitly directs the VLM’s visual analy- sis. The most advanced methods aim for deep clin- ical and spatial grounding. These models move beyond simple object detection to incorporate fine- grained anatomical knowledge, either by integrat- ing segmentation capabilities to reason about pre- cise spatial locations (Trinh by using anatomical ontologies to structure the interpreta- tion of findings in a clinically coherent manner (Li 3 --- Page 4 --- Figure 2: An overarching framework of techniques to enhance reasoning in Medical LLMs, divided into two primary stages. (a) Training-time Techniques fundamentally imbue models reasoning capabilities by modifying their internal weights through methods like Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning-aware data and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with expert feedback. (b) Test-time Techniques improve reasoning at the moment of inference. These on-the-fly strategies include Prompt-based Elicitation to guide thought processes, Reasoning Selection & Aggregation for robustness, Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning to ground responses in facts, and Multi-agent Systems that decompose complex problems for collaborative solving. et al., 2025c). 3.3 Reasoning over Code Code as a modality for medical is a new frontier, enabling procedural, verifiable, and au- tomatable workflows. Unlike text and images, the primary challenge has been to build the founda- tional ecosystem for this type of research. The narrative of progress can be seen as constructing three essential pillars. The first pillar is the environ- ment: et al., 2025b) provides a standardized, extensible, and verifiable training and evaluation "gym" for medical agents, solving need for a reproducible setting. The second pil- lar is the data: studies like al., 2023) have been crucial in analyzing and validating the richness of biomedical code available in pub- lic repositories, confirming that a sufficient data foundation exists to train capable models. The third is the platform: with an environment and data, BioDSBench (Wang al., 2024) repre- sents the integration of these ideas into a usable platform, embedding LLMs within a data science pipeline where code serves as the direct interface for medical professionals to perform complex com- putational tasks. 4 A Taxonomy of Medical Reasoning Enhancement Techniques To endow LLMs with robust medical reasoning, re- searchers have developed a suite of techniques that can be broadly categorized into two main stages: training-time techniques, which fundamentally al- ter a model’s internal weights to build foundational reasoning capabilities, and test-time techniques, which steer and refine the model’s output moment of inference without modifying the model itself. This section provides a systematic overview of these methods, illustrated in Figure 2. 4.1 Training-time Techniques: Building the Foundation Training-time methods are high-cost, high-impact interventions that aim to bake clinical logic directly into the model’s parameters. They represent the "heavy lifting" of creating a domain-specialized reasoner but face significant challenges related to data scalability. 4 --- Page 5 --- 4.1.1 Fine-tuning (SFT) SFT marks a crucial epistemological shift from learning mere correlations to learning clinical pro- cesses. By training on data containing explicit reasoning chains, the model is forced to learn the "how" and "why" of a diagnosis. The innovation lies in the design of this data and the training strat- egy. Multi-stage Fine-tuning: This approach applies the principle of curriculum learning, recognizing that complex clinical reasoning cannot be learned monolithically. The core idea is to break the skill into a sequence of manageable stages. We identify two primary strategies for this. The first, staging by task abstraction, is common for conceptual rea- soning. It builds a hierarchy from concrete knowl- edge to abstract inference. al., 2025) exemplifies this by first training on factual medical knowledge, then on interactive di- alogues, and finally on complex causal reasoning. The second strategy, staging by modality integra- tion, is crucial for multimodal tasks. It builds skills from perception to interpretation. AOR al., 2025c) is a canonical example, sequentially train- the model to first recognize anatomical struc- tures, then ground them to linguistic terms, and finally synthesize this information into a diagnostic conclusion. Chain-Aware Fine-tuning: This paradigm’s challenge is the ’supervision bottleneck’—the cost and difficulty of obtaining high-quality reasoning chains. Researchers have developed four distinct strategies to address this. The gold standard is to use human expert annotation, where clini- cians provide the consensus and rationale for rea- soning paths, as done for Med-PaLM 2 al., 2025). While authoritative, this is not scal- able. To overcome this, the most common strat- egy is using AI-generated chains. Frameworks like HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen al., 2024a) leverage powerful teacher models (e.g., GPT-4) in a sophis- ticated cycle of generation, verification, and self- correction to create vast datasets at scale, though this risks inheriting the teacher’s biases. A third, more verifiable approach is to impose external structure. al., 2025), for ex- ample, constrains generation by forcing the rea- soning path to be a valid traversal of a medical knowledge graph, making each step auditable. Fi- nally, some methods focus on refining existing data. This includes data-centric approaches like BioMed-R1 (Thapa al., 2025), which filters mul- tiple benchmarks to curate a dataset of only the most reasoning-intensive samples, and stylistic approaches like EMULATION al., 2024), which fine-tunes model to ensure its reason- ing style authentically mimics the abductive and deductive thought processes of clinicians. Position-Aware Fine-tuning: For multimodal reasoning to be clinically useful, a diagnostic claim must be grounded to a specific visual location. This technique directly tackles this critical "grounding problem" by training models on data that enforces spatial correspondence. The strategies vary by the granularity of the spatial information provided. The most foundational approach uses coarse-grained grounding with bounding boxes, which serve as explicit intermediate reasoning steps in models like et al., 2025a). For higher clinical precision, fine-grained grounding with pixel-level segmentation masks is employed. PRS- MED 2025), for instance, trains on precise masks and requires model to answer questions about these specific regions. The most so- phisticated strategy is semantically-rich ground- ing, where visual regions are linked to a formal medical vocabulary. al., 2025c) does this by aligning image areas with concepts from an anatomical ontology, allowing model to reason not just about "where" a finding is, but also "what" it is in a structured, clinically meaningful way. 4.1.2 Learning (RL) If SFT provides raw capability, RL is the alignment phase sculpting this capability to fit the nuanced goals of clinical practice: safety, accuracy, and efficiency. The core challenge in applying RL is defining "good" clinical reasoning, which has led to a spectrum of feedback strategies, from holistic human judgment to granular, automated metrics. At one end of this spectrum lies alignment with subjective, qualitative feedback. RL Human Feedback (RLHF) directly captures complex clin- ical values by training on physician preferences. For instance, al., 2025) was optimized using preference rankings from a diverse panel of physicians, allowing it to learn intangible qualities like diagnostic prudence and safety. To address the significant cost and scala- bility limitations of RLHF, RL AI Feedback (RLAIF) has emerged as a pragmatic alternative. et al., 2024a), for example, uses GPT-4o to provide scalable, binary reward sig- 5 --- Page 6 --- nals on answer correctness, using a powerful AI as a proxy for human judgment. At the other end of the spectrum lies optimiza- tion against objective, quantitative metrics using Structured Rewards. This engineering-driven approach offers scalability and reproducibility by defining explicit, measurable goals. This has be- come a powerful trend, with the policy optimiza- tion algorithm GRPO being widely used to train models on specific criteria. These include multi- faceted rationale quality (e.g., accuracy, coher- ence, and knowledge coverage in ClinRaGen (Niu et al., 2025)), precise multimodal grounding (e.g., spatial and semantic consistency in MedGround- R1 et al., 2025a)), and task-specific perfor- mance across diverse modalities and question types (e.g., Med-R1 (Lai al., 2025), GMAI-VL-R1 (Su et al., 2025)). Perhaps the most profound insight from this line of work is that RL act as an "emergence engine" for complex reasoning. Studies like Al- phaMed al., 2025b) and al., 2025) demonstrate that by using simple, ob- jective rewards (like multiple-choice accuracy) and focusing on a curated set of difficult problems, sophisticated reasoning capabilities can emerge without being explicitly taught via CoT distilla- tion. This crucial finding challenges the "bigger is better" paradigm, suggesting a viable path toward creating smaller, more efficient, yet highly capable medical reasoning models. 4.2 Test-time Techniques: Achieving Agility and Verifiability In contrast to costly retraining, test-time techniques offer a flexible, low-cost way to steer the reasoning of pre-trained models. These on-the-fly mecha- nisms represent a conceptual shift from viewing the LLM as a static oracle to a dynamic reasoning component. The strategies show a clear progres- sion in sophistication, from simple input shaping to complex, multi-agent orchestration. 4.2.1 Prompt-based Reasoning Elicitation This foundational technique uses structured prompts for "cognitive steering," compelling model to externalize its latent thought process into an explicit, step-by-step format. The ap- proach has evolved from generic (CoT) prompting (Nachane al., 2024) to domain- specific variants that emulate expert workflows. These include al., 2023), Diagnostic Reasoning CoT (DR-CoT) al., 2024a), and the formalized five-step Chain of Di- agnosis (CoD) et al., 2024b), which breaks down diagnosis into explicit steps like symptom analysis and diagnostic testing. For more complex problems, techniques like least-to-most prompting decompose tasks into simpler sub-problems (He al., 2024), while other methods use iterative ques- tioning verify claims (Vladika 2025) or extend these concepts to orchestrate multimodal analysis et al., 2024b; Zhou al., 2025). 4.2.2 and Aggregation To mitigate the inherent stochasticity of LLM out- puts, this pillar improves robustness by generat- ing and evaluating multiple reasoning paths. The methods represent different points on spectrum of computational cost versus performance gain. At the higher-cost end, self-consistency al., 2023) and ensemble reasoning (Lucas al., 2024) generate multiple candidate responses by introduc- ing randomness during decoding and then select the most frequent or highest-quality answer via major- ity vote. Other methods invest more computation into a single, more exhaustive path through time scaling et al., 2025a,b). Another way, test-time adaptation uses a small, lightweight model like MedAdapter (Shi al., 2024) as a post- hoc ranker to score and the most clinically plausible solution from a pool of candidates gener- ated by a much larger base model, achieving signif- icant gains with minimal overhead. 4.2.3 Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning These techniques address the critical issues of hal- lucination and outdated knowledge by grounding the model’s parametric memory in verifiable, ex- ternal facts. The strategies fall two main categories. The first is "just-in-time" contex- tualization via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Before answering a question, the model first queries a medical database or text corpus for relevant information, then integrates this re- trieved text into its context to generate a factually grounded answer (Hammane, 2024; Jeong al., 2024; Zhan al., 2024). The second strategy is "just-in-place" guidance, which uses structured knowledge to constrain the generation process. In- Context Padding (ICP) al., 2024b), for in- stance, injects structured "knowledge seeds" (e.g., ‘(headache, is_symptom_of, migraine)’) from a knowledge graph into the LLM’s context, 6 --- Page 7 --- guiding its generation along a logically sound and verifiable path. 4.2.4 Reasoning Systems This frontier represents a paradigm shift from a monolithic intelligence to a distributed, specialized cognitive architecture where the LLM acts as an "orchestrator." This approach decomposes complex problems into tasks solved by multiple collaborat- ing agents. We see two primary forms of collab- oration. Collaborative deliberation frameworks simulate peer review; for example, one agent might act as a ’proposer’ suggesting a diagnosis, while an- other acts as a ’critic,’ challenging the evidence to force a more robust conclusion al., 2024; Hong al., 2024). Functional decomposition frameworks assign tasks to agents with specialized tools. This allows a central orchestrator to delegate sub-tasks to an ’imaging agent’ that can call a seg- mentation model (Fallahpour al., 2025), a ’data that can execute database queries, or a ’trial that can parse clinical trial documents (Yue al., 2024). Supported by dedicated training envi- ronments et al., 2025b), this modular approach makes the entire reasoning process transparent and auditable by design (Gu Wu, 2025). 5 Applications & Use Cases 5.1 Support Medical reasoning models enhance clinical di- agnosis and decision support by delivering pre- cise, evidence-based insights to optimize health- care decisions. For example, al., 2025) specializes in joint encoding of fine-grained symptoms, signs, and lab results; its candidate-ranking strategy markedly reduces mis- diagnosis rates, al., 2025a) integrates radiology annotations directly into lan- guage–vision alignment so that “read-the-scan, write-the-report” happens in a single forward pass, shortening reporting time for common imaging studies. Existing works al., 2024a), al., 2025), and al., 2025a) automatically gen- erate a large batch of CoT reasoning drafts with verifiable mechanisms to strengthen the model’s diagnostic capability. 5.2 and Training Systems that prioritise development of explicit clinical-reasoning pathways now underpin medi- cal education. al., 2024a) guides students through structured differential-diagnosis chains and collaborative hypothesis building, while al., 2024) integrates health records with knowledge graphs to simulate realistic clinical scenarios. In simulation-based training, medical reasoning models are stress-tested in sandboxed clinical scenarios before deployment et al., 2024a; Wu and colleagues, 2025; al., 2024). These platforms like ClinicalLab (Yan al., 2024), 2024), and al., 2024) deliver interactive patient cases with real-time, adaptive feed, acting as personalized tutors that sharpen learners’ diag- nostic reasoning skills. 5.3 and Reasoning Multimodal reasoning models not only pinpoint pathological cues but also narrate their clinical relevance in plain language and link each observation to concrete next-step decisions—an evolution that promises more transparent, efficient, and trusted radiologic care et al., 2025b; Li al., 2025c). For example, PRS-Med al., 2025) improves anatomical and pathological rea- soning for precise diagnostics across diverse imag- ing modalities, and some recent studies al., 2025; al., 2025a) add RL-based methods such as GRPO (Shao 2024) to boost the quality and traceability. 5.4 Molecular Discovery models are emerging as end-to-end engines that span both design of novel therapeutics and the personalization of their clinical use. On the discovery side, et al., 2025d) treats drug-target interaction predic- tion as a sequential reasoning problem and reports a 4.92% ROC-AUC gain over strong baselines, while al., 2024) stitches together 18 chemistry tools and exposes its chain of thought to autonomously plan multi-step syntheses and sug- gest new molecular scaffolds. 5.5 Treatment Planning For the treatment planning, reasoning-centric models are being repurposed to navigate the high-dimensional design space of treatment plan- ning (Rao al., 2024; Yang al., 2025). For example, al., 2025c) sents the first MLLM agent that mimics the be- 7 --- Page 8 --- haviors of human planners in radiation oncology clinics, achieving promising results in automat- ing the treatment planning process without need for additional training. al., 2025) offers a comprehensive benchmark that assesses LLMs on the factual accuracy, com- pleteness, and computational efficiency of their treatment-planning rationales. Collectively, these advances position medical-reasoning LLMs as transparent, end-to-end copilots capable of acceler- ating drug discovery and delivering more precise, patient-specific therapies. 6 Evaluation & Benchmarking 6.1 Accuracy Assessment Traditional evaluation benchmarks al., 2020; Pal et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2019; Hendrycks et al., 2021b,a) use accuracy measures such as exact match or multiple-choice score on known-answer questions derived from medical exams. However, top-tier LLMs now achieve near-expert scores on several routine medical QA tests like et al., 2020) and et al., 2019). This success underscores need for more difficult eval- uation sets that move beyond straightforward recall of medical facts. Recent studies have developed new benchmarks that emphasize complex, multi-step rea- soning and hard-to-solve questions (Gaber For example, (Zuo al., 2025) incorporates specialty board review ques- tions and performs multi-round expert reviews to build a high-quality benchmark. MedAgentsBench al., 2025) focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, treatment planning. By concentrating on truly difficult cases and standard- izing evaluation, these benchmarks push models beyond rote knowledge retrieval, revealing perfor- mance gaps that were obscured by easier questions. 6.2 Quality Assessment In medical scenarios, particularly high-stakes sit- uations, the quality of the reasoning process is just as crucial as reaching the correct conclusion al., 2024; al., 2025b; Zhu For example, (Qiu al., 2025) introduces a “Reasoning Evaluator”, an au- tomated tool that scores free-text clinical reasoning responses along multiple dimensions: efficiency, actuality, and completeness. al., 2025) is proposed to assess the factual correctness, completeness, and effectiveness of in a model’s explanation, using clinically validated rea- soning chains as references. HealthBench (Arora 2025) is designed to capture realistic clini- cal reasoning—diagnostic triage, patient education, tailoring depth to user expertise, and safety-critical decision steps, while AgentClinic(Schmidgall al., 2024) and al., 2025) simulate the process of a doctor’s clinical reasoning, includ- ing asking questions, arranging tests, and making the final diagnosis. 6.3 Interpretability Assessment The ability to visually interpret a model’s decisions is essential for building trust, ensuring clinical ac- ceptance, and safeguarding patient outcomes. Re- cent evaluation frameworks have specifically fo- cused on testing a model’s capacity to visually jus- tify its reasoning and link its outputs to relevant im- age or textual data. al., 2025) integrates vision-language models with capabilities to generate not only ac- curate segmentation masks but also corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. RJUA-MedDQA al., 2024) evaluates whether a model can read vi- sually complex medical documents, extract the cor- rect evidence, and produce an answer that clearly cites or grounds its reasoning in the source data. In chest X-ray diagnosis, et al., 2024, 2025a) and al., 2025c) both focus on region-level, multi-step reasoning by evaluating the visual grounding and structured processes. 7 Discussion: Challenges & Future Directions While progress in medical reasoning LLMs is ac- celerating, significant hurdles remain before they can be considered safe and effective clinical tools. Moving from promising research to widespread adoption requires confronting a series of distinct challenges in model capability, evaluation, and real- world implementation. 7.1 The Faithfulness-Plausibility Gap A primary danger is ‘plausible hallucination,’ where models generate clinically plausible but fac- tually incorrect explanations—a critical mismatch between rhetoric and ground truth al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2024a). This is more perilous than a simple wrong answer; a model might invent 8 --- Page 9 --- lab values that perfectly fit a diagnostic narrative, leading a clinician to a correct conclusion for the wrong reasons, thereby masking the model’s flawed logic. Addressing this requires moving beyond surface-level explanations. One promising egy impose external structure, for instance by constraining generation with knowledge graph, which forces the reasoning be a se- quence of verifiable ‘(subject, predicate, object)‘ triples al., 2025). The ultimate goal, how- ever, is to build models with intrinsic epistemic humility—the ability to express calibrated uncer- tainty and explicitly differentiate between evidence- backed claims and speculative inference. 7.2 Toward Native Multimodal Reasoning Current vision-language models often use a loosely coupled architecture, fusing static image and text representations late in the process al., 2025a). This fails to capture the dynamic, iterative nature of clinical reasoning. For example, model might correctly identify "cardiomegaly" from an image and "shortness of breath" from text, but fail to infer the crucial causal link that the former is causing the latter because it cannot re-interrogate the visual data in light of the textual data. The next frontier to build natively multimodal architectures that can interleave visual and textual tokens in a shared reasoning process. This involves developing tech- niques like iterative cross-modal attention, the abil- ity to edit visual tokens during a chain-of-thought process, and image-grounded counterfactual analy- sis ("what if this shadow were not present?"). 7.3 The Efficiency-Performance Frontier A persistent tension exists between a model’s rea- soning quality and its computational footprint. The most powerful reasoning strategies, such as multi- step CoT al., 2023; Wang al., 2023) or multi-agent debate al., 2024), demand significant computational resources and introduce latency, making them impractical for many real-time clinical settings. has catalyzed vital research into "reasoning smarter, not harder." One direction is lightweight post-hoc adaptation, which is a form of results distillation; a small, effi- cient model is trained not on knowledge itself, but on the task of ranking the outputs of a larger, more powerful model al., 2024). An even more profound insight comes from eliciting emergent reasoning, where studies show that complex rea- soning can be "discovered" through goal-oriented reinforcement learning on hard problems, rather than purely "imitated" through SFT al., 2025b). This suggests a path to- ward smaller, more efficient models that possess powerful reasoning capabilities. 7.4 Evaluation Beyond Task Accuracy The field faces an evaluation crisis: as models sat- urate static benchmarks et al., 2019) and al., 2025), their scores mask real-world reasoning deficits. Progress requires paradigm shift in evaluation. This entails moving to dynamic, longitudinal benchmarks that simulate a full patient journey with multimodal data et al., 2025c; al., 2024). More importantly, it demands a focus be- yond final-answer accuracy to a granular assess- ment reasoning process itself—scrutinizing its factual correctness, logical coherence, and evi- dence adherence, as pioneered by frameworks like ChestX-Reasoner 2025). For multi- modal models, this must also include quantifiable metrics for grounding and interpretability. Ultimately, automated scores are insufficient; the gold standard for validation must incorporate qual- itative review by clinical experts to assess true clin- ical utility and rigorous stress-testing against rare "edge case" diseases where models are most likely to fail. 7.5 Prerequisites for Responsible Clinical Adoption Even a technically perfect and rigorously evalu- ated model will fail if it cannot navigate the com- plex human and regulatory environment of health- care. Responsible adoption hinges on a founda- tion of sociotechnical trust. This begins with the non-negotiable requirement of patient privacy; under regulations like HIPAA and GDPR, privacy- preserving techniques like Federated Learning (FL) are a critical architectural prerequisite (Jahan al., 2025; Abbas al., 2025a). Beyond data handling, responsible deployment demands ad- dressing the model’s potential for algorithmic bias. This includes mitigating both demographic biases, which can worsen health inequities (Sandi, 2025), and cognitive biases, which replicate known pat- terns of human diagnostic error (Kim al., 2025). Ultimately, both privacy and fairness are compo- nents of the largest challenge: establishing clear ac- countability and trust. Closing the "accountabil- 9 --- Page 10 --- ity gap" (Habli al., 2020) requires a robust frame- work built on shared responsibility policies for de- velopers and institutions (Information Technology Industry Council, 2024), inherently auditable and explainable AI systems 2024), and effective Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows that empower clinicians as informed arbiters, not passive users of a black box. 8 Conclusion This systematic review analyzes the crucial evolu- tion Language Models toward complex medical reasoning, presenting a core taxonomy of the and test-time techniques en- abling this capability. We survey the application of these reasoning techniques in LLMs across di- verse medical modalities and clinical domains, and track the parallel shift in evaluation from measur- ing accuracy to validating reasoning process it- self. We identify formidable remaining in model faithfulness, multimodal integration, ef- ficiency, and responsible sociotechnical adoption. Overcoming these hurdles is the critical path to real- izing the promise of Medical LLMs as trustworthy and interpretable reasoning partners in healthcare. Limitations While this paper provides a comprehensive system- atic review, several limitations should be acknowl- edged. Our analysis is inherently constrained by the scope of publicly available literature, exclud- ing proprietary models from industrial labs and potentially missing very recent pre-prints due to the field’s rapid evolution. Our keyword-based search, while systematic, might also have inad- vertently omitted papers using alternative termi- nologies. Furthermore, the taxonomy we propose is an interpretative lens; other valid frameworks could exist, and in prioritizing breadth to provide a panoramic overview, we could not delve into the deepest technical nuances of every method. Ulti- mately, this review serves as a snapshot of a rapidly moving target, and future breakthroughs may ne- cessitate revisions to our framework. References Haider Abbas, Omar M.

Title: MELAC: Massive Evaluation of Large Language Models with Alignment of Culture in Persian Language Authors: Farhan Farsi, Farnaz Aghababaloo, Shahriar Shariati Motlagh, Parsa Ghofrani, MohammadAli SadraeiJavaheri, Shayan Bali, Amirhossein Shabani, Farbod Bijary, Ghazal Zamaninejad, AmirMohammad Salehoof, Saeedeh Momtazi Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00673v1 --- Page 1 --- Persian Language Farhan Farsi1∗, Farnaz Aghababaloo2∗, Shahriar Shariati Motlagh3∗, Parsa Ghofrani1, MohammadAli SadraeiJavaheri2, Shayan Bali4, Amirhossein Shabani2, Farbod Bijary1, Ghazal Zamaninejad2, AmirMohammad Salehoof2, Saeedeh Momtazi1 1Amirkabir University of Technology, 2Part AI Research Center, 3University of Mazandaran, 4King’s College London {farhan1379, parsa.ghofrani, farbod.bijary, momtazi}@aut.ac.ir, [EMAIL], [EMAIL], {farnaz.babalou, mohammad.sadraei, amirhosein.shabani, ghazal.zamaninezhad, amirmohammad.salehoof}@partdp.ai Abstract As large language models (LLMs) be- come increasingly embedded in our daily lives, evaluating their quality and reliabil- ity across diverse contexts has become es- sential. While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM performance in En- glish, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiar- ity with non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on top- ics such as Iranian law, Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance ex- ams. Using these datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field. 1 Introduction Language Models (LLMs) have experi- enced significant advancements in recent years, including in real-world applications, even those that require in-field expertise, such as software development (Jimenez et al., 2023; Sabouri et al., 2025), law (Sun et al., 2024; Cheong et al., 2024), medical science (Goyal al., 2024; Kim et al., 2023), and religious studies (Trepczynski, 2023). Researchers attributed this surprising enhancement to emerging capa- bilities that happen in bigger models during training (Wei et al., 2022). Nowadays, exploring what LLMs can’t do, as opposed to what they can do, has become an interesting topic of study which sheds light on future development (Chen et al., 2024). One ∗Equal contribution. of these Achilles’ heels is when they require cultural context to answer questions (Pawar et al., 2025). This issue is echoed more boldly when analyzing culture with limited internet- based data, as Iranian culture (Shamsfard et al., 2025; Hosseinbeigi et al., 2025a) and Persian language (Rajabi and Valavi, 2021). Benchmarking LLMs on languages and cul- tures that have been underrepresented in eval- uation—such as Persian—is a vital step toward building AI systems capable of engaging more meaningfully and empathetically with diverse user communities. As LLMs evolve, the de- velopment of comprehensive evaluation frame- works, particularly for non-English languages, has become more crucial for robust benchmark- ing of performance and reliability across diverse linguistic contexts (Hodak et al., 2023). Our key contributions are as follows: (I) Curating New Datasets: We created 13 datasets to better evaluate LLMs on Iranian culture and Persian linguistics. (II) Adapting Well-Known Datasets to Persian: Beyond translation, we align well- known datasets with language and Ira- nian cultural context. (III) Comprehensive Evaluation on Pri- vate Test Sets: We evaluate 41 LLMs to robustly analyze model families and parameter effects, using private test sets to minimize data contamination. We hope our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of capabilities of LLMs in Per- sian language and support ongoing efforts to develop better datasets and LLMs in Persian language. 2 Related work The rapid adoption of LLMs across domains has highlighted the need for their evaluation 1 arXiv:2508.00673v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- from diverse linguistic and cultural perspec- tives. Early efforts like Hugging Face’s Open LLM Leaderboard benchmark models in mul- tiple languages (Lai 2023), and eval- uation datasets such as MMLU-pro (Wang et al., 2024) and ARC (Clark et al., 2018) have spurred translation-based adaptations for Chinese (He al., 2024), European (Thell- mann al., 2024), and Indian (KJ et al., 2025) languages. Yet, translation alone falls short of full localization, prompting a shift toward culturally grounded benchmarks (Zhou al., 2025) that ensure both linguistic accuracy and cultural relevance. Recent efforts have intro- duced culturally aligned datasets for underrep- resented communities, including Arabic (Qian al., 2024; Nacar al., 2025), Korean (Kim 2024), and Russian (Vasilev al., 2025), paving the way for more equitable and context- aware LLM evaluation. Building on the efforts to adapt datasets for different languages and cultures, Persian language has also seen advancements in velopment of resources for LLM training (Hos- seinbeigi et al., 2025b; et al., 2022) and evaluation (Hosseinbeigi et al., 2025a; Shams- fard al., 2025). Parsbench (Motlagh, 2025) has emerged as the first Persian leaderboard, specifically evaluating LLMs using translations of well-known English datasets. Furthermore, Farsi et al. (2025) has developed the first bench- mark for visual language models in Persian by generating five new datasets. Ghahroodi et al. (2024) have also contributed by produc- ing a Persian version of the MMLU datasets, encompassing 38 diverse tasks with 20,192 four- choice questions extracted from Persian exami- nations. Moreover, Hosseinbeigi et al. (2025a) has advanced language and cultural benchmarking through the introduction of two new datasets: PeKA, a compilation of Per- sian mobile application games with diverse, user-generated questions, and PK-BETS, fo- cusing on Persian knowledge and bias ethics categories, albeit with a relatively small sample size of 4,000. The work most closely related to ours is that of Shamsfard et al. (2025), who also look at the LLM benchmarking problem from the cultural perspective. They curated relatively small 4,000 question-answer pairs, including topics like medicine, law, religion, social knowledge, ethics, and bias specific to Iranian culture. The questions were in the form of multiple-choice answers as well as open text generation. They benchmarked three LLMs, including Llama3- 70B, and two other Farsi-specific LLMs on their benchmark. While useful, they didn’t utilize well-established current datasets in English. 3 Benchmark As discussed earlier, this research aims to cre- ate a benchmark that enhances understanding of LLM capabilities, focusing on not only Persian language but also Iranian culture, par- ticularly within the Iranian context. Our con- tributions are divided into two main categories. (i) Creating New Original Datasets. (ii) Trans- lation and Localization of Available Datasets. Detailed information about all datasets and their categories is presented in Table1. 3.1 New Original Datasets A key challenge in evaluating LLMs is the po- tential overlap between their training and test- ing data al., 2023). Research suggests that some LLMs may achieve inflated scores due to the public availability of these datasets (Singh al., 2025). Therefore, creating new datasets for benchmarking and keeping them private is essential. Furthermore, aspects such as legal regulations, cultural norms, and re- ligious rules are often specific to individual countries and vary significantly from one to another. Consequently, it is crucial to develop new datasets that encompass these unique ele- ments. In this research, we introduce 13 new datasets crafted to encompass various aspects, including legal systems, stereotypes, religious inquiries, literature, and more. In what fol- lows, we provide a description of each of these datasets. Multiple-Wiki: This dataset consists of 1,000 multiple-choice extracted from the SynTran-Fa dataset (Farsi al., 2024) which is a dataset about general knowledge. Questions that did not meet the criteria outlined by al., 2024) were eliminated. Subsequently, incorrect answer options were manually created by one of the co-authors of this paper. The reliability of these questions was then verified by two undergraduate students. 2 --- Page 3 --- Dataset Category Field Metric #Samples Parsi-Lit Original Persian Linguistic Accuracy 777 DC-Homograph Linguistic Accuracy 108 MC-Homograph Linguistic Accuracy 434 Proverbs-Quiz Linguistic Accuracy 370 Verb-Eval Linguistic Accuracy 3,567 Religion-Rules Original Persian Legals Accuracy 175 Iran-Law Legals Accuracy 300 Persian-Hellaswag Original Common Sense Reasoning Accuracy 1,361 Expert-Eval Original Domain Specific Knowledge Accuracy 49,669 ReadingCompQA-text Original Reading Comprehension QA F1-Score 1,000 ReadingCompQA-y/n Comprehension QA Accuracy 1,000 Multiple-Wiki Original General Knowledge Accuracy 1,000 ParsTrivia Knowledge Accuracy 392 MMLU-pro Translated Accuracy 1,000 PIQA Knowledge Accuracy 999 Arc-Challenge Translated Reasoning Accuracy 936 Arc-Easy Reasoning Accuracy 935 Winogrande Reasoning Accuracy 1,129 GSM Translated Specific Knowledge Exact-Match 1,000 Table 1: Overview of datasets that we create in this research. Parsi-Lit: Persian language possesses a rich literary heritage encompassing diverse forms of poetry, prose, and classical texts. Building on this cultural wealth, we developed a dataset containing multiple-choice questions sourced from Persian literature curriculum spanning grades 7 through 12. This educational dataset captures the unique linguistic and literary ele- ments characteristic of Persian literary tradi- tion. Iran-Law: To evaluate LLMs understanding of country-specific regulations, we introduce Iran-Law, a dataset comprising multiple-choice questions focused on Iranian legal frameworks. The dataset was developed through a rigor- ous process involving three domain experts, each holding a PhD in legal studies. Each expert crafted different questions covering di- verse aspects of Iranian legislation. To ensure quality and accuracy, we implemented a cross- validation process where experts reviewed each other’s questions, establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing models legal domain knowledge. Religion-Rules: We present a comprehensive dataset addressing religious diversity in Iran, encompassing multiple faiths: Islam (both Shi’a and Sunni), and Zoroastrianism. To ensure authenticity and accuracy in religious content, we collaborated with clergymen from each faith tradition to develop original multiple- choice questions. The dataset comprises vari- ous questions distributed as follows: questions covering Islamic jurisprudence (Shi’a and Sunni traditions) and questions for Zoroastrian reli- gious practices. This expert-driven approach was chosen over translation-based methods to maintain doctrinal precision and cultural sen- sitivity. Verb-Eval: We introduce Verb-Eval, a com- prehensive dataset designed to on their understanding of Persian verb gram- mar. This dataset, seeded with an initial col- lection of approximately 10,000 Persian simple and compound verbs (Rasooli et al., 2011), served as a foundation for creating the evalu- ation set. To ensure quality, we filtered out uncommon verbs and selectively sampled com- pound verbs sharing the same simple root. Us- ing automated scripts, we generated verb forms across various tenses, pronouns, and passive structures, organized into seven distinct lin- guistic tasks. Two tasks focus on identification: TenseDetection (recognizing a verb’s tense) and InfinitiveDetection (finding the correct infini- tive). Another task, VerbDetection, assesses conjugation by asking the model to produce a specific verb form from an infinitive based on tense, pronoun, count, and definiteness. Two transformation tasks evaluate morphological manipulation: TenseTransform, which modi- fies a verb’s tense while holding other features constant, and PronounTransform, modi- fies the pronoun and count while keeping the tense fixed. The final tasks, TransitiveDetec- tion and VerbTypeDetection, test the models ability to classify a verb’s transitivity and its structural type (e.g., simple, compound). This 3 --- Page 4 --- benchmark offers valuable insights into the ca- pabilities of LLMs and their tokenizers in an- alyzing the structural complexities of Persian verbs. Proverbs-Quiz: Proverbs-Quiz was devel- oped by collecting a seed set of 370 unique and widely used proverbs in Persian literature and everyday language and the meaning of each one from online sources. Each question in the dataset presents a proverb as context, with four answer options randomly selected from the meanings of other proverbs in the seed data. This design enables the assessment of of Persian idioms and figurative expressions, which are essential for comprehending and generating culturally rich texts. MC-Homograph: Recognizing homo- graphs—words with identical spelling but different meanings—is crucial for clear Persian communication, preventing ambiguity. The Multiple Choice-Homograph dataset is an evaluation set featuring four-option questions. An expert compiled Persian homographs, including their phonemes, meanings, and example contexts, to create this set. Each question presents a homograph within a contextual sentence, requiring users to select its correct meaning from the provided options. This dataset assesses a ability to accurately interpret homographs in specific contexts. DC-Homograph: The Dual-Context Ho- mograph presents a more complex challenge compared to the Multiple Choice- Homograph dataset. It was developed using the existing collection of Persian homographs, with a LLM prompted to create contexts that incorporate both meanings of each homograph. Prompts included the homograph’s phoneme, and example usage to ensure the LLM generated accurate and relevant samples. Human reviewers then refined the contexts through multiple rounds of editing or removing unsuitable entries to produce the final ation set. The consists of two-option questions, tasking models with identifying the intended meaning of either the first or second instance of the homograph based on subtle contextual cues. This dataset thoroughly eval- uates advanced of Persian ho- mographs and underscores the complexities of resolving lexical ambiguity. ParsTrivia: ParsTrivia is a four-choice multiple-choice to evaluate the general knowledge capabilities of models in Persian. The questions in this dataset reflect what are commonly known in Iran as ú×ñÔ« HA«C£@ HB@ñ (”general knowledge questions”), which are widely used in quizzes, competitions, and educational contexts. The data was collected by crawling general knowl- edge questions available on various persian web- sites. This multi-domain benchmark provides a broad assessment of ability to compre- hend and respond to diverse factual knowledge questions in Persian. Expert-Eval: Expert-Eval is a special- ized benchmark evaluate the expert-level knowledge language models across three academic tiers: Olympiad-level, Master’s-level, and Ph.D.-level questions. To construct the dataset, we collected questions from several reputable Iranian examination sources, including national student Olympiads, the Master’s entrance exam, the Ph.D. en- trance exam, and two specialized professional assessments: the Legal Apprenticeship License Exam ( IËA¿ð ø PñÓ@PA¿ é K@ðQK àAJ A®JÓ QK YK àñÓ P@) and the Professional Competency Exam for Psychologists and Counselors ( à@PðA Ó ð àAA J ' à@ðP ø@'é ¯Qk IJ kC àñÓ P@). All materials were obtained from publicly available PDFs or image files on the internet. Since the original content was not in an editable format, a team of 30 typists manually transcribed the questions. Additionally, all mathematical and scientific formulas were typeset in LaTeX to ensure clarity and to align with the input format best understood by LLMs. The dataset spans a wide range of domains, including mathematics, engineering, law, psychology, medicine, history, the Persian language, and more. Inspired by the structure the MMLU dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021), Expert-Eval is organized into four categories: Humanities, Social Sciences, STEM, and Others. The questions are presented in a multiple-choice format, typically with four options, though some extend to five, allowing for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs advanced capabilities and subject-matter expertise across diverse disciplines. 4 --- Page 5 --- Persian-Hellaswag: Persian-Hellaswag is a multiple-choice designed to evalu- ate the ability language models to predict the most plausible continuation of a given context in Persian. Adapted from the original English HellaSwag dataset, this Persian variant focuses on commonsense reasoning and narrative com- pletion. Since of the main sources cited in the original paper was the WikiHow website, we also used the version of this site1 and crawled it accordingly. We then constructed sentence continuation questions based on the articles from this site, as it provides step-by- step explanations for performing various tasks. Each instance presents a short context followed by four candidate continuations, from which the model must select the most coherent and contextually appropriate ending. This bench- mark tests models reasoning and coherence generation in Persian, offering in- sights into their contextual understanding and narrative prediction capabilities. ReadingCompQA-text: We introduce ReadingCompQA-text, dataset comprising 1,000 questions evaluate LLMs reading comprehension abilities. Each ques- tion is generated from a unique text passage, ensuring broad topical coverage and diversity. Answers are explicitly present within the source text and can be precisely identified using char- acter index spans, facilitating exact answer localization. This design allows for both span extraction and answer generation tasks, pro- viding a clear framework for evaluating models comprehension skills. The dataset serves as a practical benchmark assessing models abil- ity to process, understand, and retrieve factual information from textual content. ReadingCompQA-y/n: ReadingCompQA- y/n a dataset of 1,000 yes/no questions, each derived from a distinct text passage, reading comprehension abili- ties in a binary response setting. Each question targets a specific fact or statement directly in- ferable from the source text, requiring models to answer strictly with “yes” or “no.” The dataset covers diverse topics to challenge mod- els across varying contexts. By focusing on binary classification based on text understand- ing, ReadingCompQA-y/n provides a focused 1https://www.wikihowfarsi.com assessing models fac- tual comprehension and reasoning accuracy. 3.2 Translation of Available Datasets To facilitate a meaningful comparison LLMs across different languages, we developed new datasets by translating and localizing well- known standard datasets used in prominent leaderboards.2 In our approach to convert English bench- mark datasets into Persian localized datasets, we employed a multi-step agnatic workflow sim- ilar to the methods used by Robinson et al. (2023); Gao et al. (2024b); Wu et al. (2024). Initially, we used the GPT-o4-mini model to identify words within each of the orig- inal datasets that required conversion to Per- sian localized terms. After a manual review, we provided GPT-o4-mini with a dictionary of English words and their corresponding Persian localized equivalents according to the context to facilitate translation into Persian. Finally, to ensure and cultural alignment, the translations underwent an ad- ditional manual review by three Iranian indi- viduals with at least C1 proficiency in English. Experts were consulted for instances requiring specialized knowledge. The inter-rater relia- bility of these reviews was quantified using Cohen’s kappa score, which yielded a score of 0.92, indicating perfect agreement. The de- tailed evaluation methodologies and results, including scores and evaluators’ criteria, are documented in Appendix D. This translation and localization process resulted in the follow- ing benchmark datasets: Arc-Easy: A subset of the AI2 Reasoning Challenge dataset containing elementary-level science designed to test basic reason- ing and scientific knowledge. These questions are characterized by their straightforward na- ture and require fundamental scientific under- standing. Arc-Challenge: The more complex counter- part of ARC Easy, featuring advanced scientific reasoning questions that require sophisticated problem-solving skills, multi-step logical infer- ence, and deeper knowledge. These 2See: Open English Leaderboard, Open French Leader- board, Open Korean Leaderboard, Open Arabic Leaderboard 5 --- Page 6 --- questions are specifically selected for their dif- ficulty in being answered through simple text matching or retrieval. MMLU-pro: An advanced of the Mas- sive Multitask Language Understanding bench- mark, covering professional-level knowledge across various fields including law, medicine, engineering, and business. This dataset tests models capabilities in specialized professional domains requiring expert-level understanding. GSM: (Grade School Math) A collection of high-quality mathematics word problems that target grade-school math reasoning. These problems require multi-step problem-solving abilities and test models capacity for mathe- matical reasoning in practical contexts. PIQA: PIQA (Physical Interaction Question Answering) dataset is to evaluate ability to reason about everyday physi- cal commonsense. dataset was originally inspired by instructables website.3 Each in- stance consists of a goal and two possible so- lutions, testing the models understanding of how objects and actions interact in the physical world. Winogrande: Winogrande dataset is a bench- mark to evaluate commonsense rea- soning through pronoun resolution tasks that are challenging for language models. It is a reformulation of the original Winograd Schema Challenge, offering a larger and more diverse set of sentence pairs that require understanding subtle contextual cues to determine the correct referent of a pronoun. Each example presents a sentence with a blank and two candidate op- tions, where only one leads to a coherent and commonsense interpretation. 4 Evaluation Protocol We evaluated all of our introduced datasets using 41 well-known models that have demon- strated good performance in the Persian lan- guage. These models range from those fine- tuned specifically on Persian language, such as Maral (MaralGPT and Muhammadreza Haghiri, 2025), PersianMind (Rostami al., 2024), Dorna (PartAI, 2025a), Dorna2 (PartAI, 2025b) and Hormoz4 to well-established mul- tilingual LLMs across a range of parameters, 3https://www.instructables.com 4Hormoz LLM including GPT family (Hurst al., 2024; Ope- nAI Team, 2025; Achiam al., 2023), Gemini- 2 family (Pichai al., 2024), Gemma fam- ily (Team et al., 2025, 2024), Qwen family (Yang al., 2025, 2024b,a), LLaMA family (Grattafiori al., 2024; Meta AI Team, 2024), Hermes-3 (Teknium 2024) and the Co- here family (Aryabumi al., 2024; Dang al., 2024). 4.1 Evaluation Methodology We adopted the evaluation methodology from EleutherAI’s lm-evaluation-harness (Gao et al., 2024a), extending it to support both local and API-based model settings. We evalu- ated open-source models hosted locally, well as proprietary models accessed via APIs. The methodology varies depending on the model type and task category—either multiple-choice questions or open-ended generation. For locally hosted models, we utilize vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) for serving. All bfloat16 and float32 checkpoints are served using bfloat16 precision. Model checkpoints avail- able only in float16 precision (such as some Cohere family models) served using float16. For multiple-choice tasks, we fol- low the log-probability-based approach used in lm-evaluation-harness. For each sample, every option is appended to the input prompt, and the models log-probability for the corre- sponding tokens is computed. The total score for the i-th option, is calculated as: ni−1 X j=m log P(xj | x0:j) Where x0:m is the input prompt and xm:ni is the i-th possible option (EleutherAI, 2021). The option with the highest total log- probability is selected as the models prediction for sample k: ˆyk = arg max i∈{1,2,...,Ok} x0:j) Where Ok is the number of options for sample k. The accuracy for sample k is computed as the indicator function of ˆyk = yk: sk = 1=yk(ˆyk) = ( 1 if ˆyk = yk 0 otherwise 6 --- Page 7 --- This process is repeated for all samples, and the overall accuracy is averaged across N samples: Accuracy = 1 N N X k=1 sk For generative tasks, we used standard com- pletions and applied robust regex patterns to extract the final answer from the generated output. Performance is then measured using exact match and F1 scores against the reference answers. For accessed via API, we employ a different strategy for choice-based tasks. We leverage structured output features to force model to generate a JSON object with a ”best answer” key, where the value is restricted to of the valid options. The ex- tracted answer is then to the target for accuracy scoring. Evaluation of genera- tive tasks for API-based models follows the same procedure as for locally hosted models: we request a standard completion, extract the answer via regex, and evaluate it exact match or F1. Because all models we evaluated were instruction-tuned, all multiple-choice tasks are evaluated in a zero-shot setting without any system prompt. tasks, we use a 3-shot context to guide the models toward generating only the final answer, avoiding un- necessary continuation or explanation. For all multiple-choice questions, we enumerate op- tions numerically (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). We also examined the effect of using alphabetical op- tion identifiers (e.g., A, B, C, D) instead of nu- merical ones, and found that this variation has minimal impact on model performance (see Ap- pendix C for details). To ensure reproducibility, all evaluations were conducted with a temper- ature of 0 to ensure deterministic output. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics Our evaluation metrics are categorized on the task type. For generation used the exact match evaluation method alongside F1 score. For tasks involving multiple-choice questions, accuracy served as the primary met- ric. 5 Results and Discussion To enhance the interpretability of evaluating LLMs, we categorized the datasets into the following groups: Persian Linguistic: This category includes such as Verb-Eval, MC-Homograph, DC-Homograph, Proverbs-Quiz and Parsi-Lit. Persian Legals: such as Iran-Law, and Religion-Rules. Reading Comprehension QA: such as ReadingCompQA-y/n, and ReadingCompQA- text. General Knowledge: This group comprises datasets including ParsTrivia, PIQA, MMLU- pro, and Multiple-Wiki. Domain Specific Knowledge: Encompasses datasets like Expert-Eval and GSM. Common Sense Reasoning: Contains such as Winogrande, Persian- Hellaswag, ARC-Easy, and ARC-Challenge. We evaluated 41 LLMs across these categories, as shown in Table 2, which presents the performance of these models across different categories. The results are detailed in terms of accuracy for multiple-choice datasets F1 scores for generation tasks. The findings under- score a significant need for improvement in ability to manage the Persian language. Even those models fine-tuned with Persian corpora demonstrate notable performance limitations. Moreover, closed-source models consistently outperform open-source ones, underscoring their effectiveness in managing these datasets. Notably, performance was particularly poor on datasets specifically culture and Persian language, with results significantly lower compared to those achieved on other datasets. To assess LLMs familiarity with Iranian culture, we examined their performance on Persian-Iranian specific datasets. The results show that all LLMs performed poorly, with only one model among the 41 achieving over 50% accuracy, indicating limited cultural un- derstanding and need for new, culturally aligned datasets. 6 Conclusion In this study, we addressed the existing gap in evaluating models (LLMs) 7 --- Page 8 --- for Persian language by introducing sev- eral new datasets. These datasets fall into two categories: (i) translations and localizations of well-known datasets adapted to language, and (ii) datasets newly created specifically for this purpose. To- gether, these datasets comprehensively cover all aspects of LLM usage in this linguistic con- text. Our results reveal that, currently, the Ope- nAI model family outperforms others on tasks involving language and demon- strates a comparatively better understanding of Iranian contexts. However, even these mod- els—similar to others, including those specif- ically fine-tuned for Persian—display perfor- mance weaknesses on that are distinctly Iranian or Persian-specific. Furthermore, our experiments investigating the impact of model size show a positive cor- relation between number of parameters in and their performance within each model family. 7 Limitations Our study has two main limitations regarding the scope of our datasets and evaluation tasks. First, the creation of our new benchmarks involved inherent challenges. For a large-scale dataset like Expert-Eval, the meticulous pro- cess of transcribing thousands of samples from static documents means that despite a careful verification workflow, the potential for occa- sional minor errors or inconsistencies remains. The scale of this dataset a broad mea- sure of model performance, which is intended to complement the specific cultural insights gained from our smaller datasets. Further- more, our findings are primarily shaped by the Iranian context represented in the data; we believe future work would benefit significantly from expanding this scope to include broader Persian-speaking communities. Second, the study’s focus on multiple-choice and specific generative tasks may not fully cap- ture the complete range of an LLMs capabil- ities. Important skills such as long-form text generation and dialogue coherence in Persian were not assessed. These areas present valuable avenues for future investigation and benchmark development.

Culture is not trivia: Sociocul- tural theory for cultural nlp. arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.12057. 12 --- Page 13 --- A Sampling Method For selecting instances from datasets, particu- larly those with sub-categories like MMLU-pro and ARC, we adhere to the original dataset proportions. To ensure diversity, we utilize k-means clustering on the dataset instances based on their embeddings generated using BERT. The optimal number of clusters, k, is determined via the elbow method. Samples are then drawn from each cluster proportional to its size, enhancing the representativeness of our selection. B Complete Results Tables 6 and 7 present performance of 41 models on translated/localized datasets and original, respectively. C Option Format Comparison To investigate whether language models ex- hibit any bias toward specific option formats, we conducted an experiment comparing nu- merical and alphabetical option identifiers. Specifically, we selected one small and one large model from each of three model fami- lies—Cohere, Qwen, and Gemma—to exam- ine potential biases across both small- and large-scale models within each family. The six models evaluated were aya-expanse-32b, aya-expanse-8b, gemma-3-27b-it, gemma- 3-12b-it, Qwen3-32B and Qwen3-8B. We evaluated the models on three multiple- choice benchmarks: ARC-Challenge, ARC- Easy and Winogrande. These tasks were selected because their English leaderboard ver- sions typically use alphabetical option formats (e.g., ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, etc.), making them suitable for assessing effect of switching from numer- ical (1–10) to alphabetical (A–J) identifiers. As in Table 5, the average accuracy differences between the two formats are min- imal across all models. Most models exhibit differences of around 1%, with the exception of Qwen3-32B, which shows a slightly larger variation of approximately 2%. Overall, these results suggest that model performance is gen- erally consistent regardless of whether numer- ical or option formats are used, indicating no strong format bias. D Evaluation Guideline D.1 Human Evaluation In human evaluation, four evaluators, each a native Persian speaker with a Master’s degree and proficiency in English, assess transla- tion quality by assigning a score from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the lowest quality and 10 signifies the best quality. The evaluations are on the following criteria: • Ambiguity: Assign score of 0 if the translation is ambiguous. • Incorrect Word Translation: Deduct 2 points for each incorrectly translated word that does not change the sentence’s overall meaning. if the incorrect translation alters the sentence’s meaning. Note that words altered during the localization process are exempt from these deductions. • Grammatical Errors: Deduct 0.5 for each grammatical error does not impact the meaning (e.g., incorrect arti- cle). • Accuracy: If the translation preserves the original meaning and clarity, start from a perfect score and adjust accord- ing to these guidelines. D.2 Automatic Evaluation: In line with Bacciu et al. (2024), we configured the GPT-4 model with a temperature setting to ensure precise and consistent responses. The evaluation process utilized the same guide- lines as those used by our human annotators. Table 3 presents the scores assigned by an- notators to the translation of datasets.

At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level: individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance—that is, a series of sentences—as a whole, Pair Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model (PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document. The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most challenging aspect of this year’s shared task: the notorious problem of “stylistically shallow”, short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed benchmark data. Evaluated on the official PAN 2025 test datasets, the model achieves strong macro-F1 scores of 0.923, 0.828, and 0.724 on the EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD data, respectively, outperforming not only the official random baselines but also a much more challenging one: claude-3.7-sonnet’s zero-shot performance.

Introduction Detecting changes in writing style—in other words, identifying places within document where stylistic signal changes—is a form of authorship analysis that, perhaps alongside authorship verification, holds the greatest potential for applications beyond industrial contexts, particularly in humanities research. Given that our contemporary concept of individual authorship—let alone formal definitions of intellectual property and copyright—is a relatively recent development, a substantial part of human written culture goes back to periods when, broadly speaking, “collaborative writing” (actual co-authorship, extensive reuse, interpolation to mention but a few of its possible forms), was not only common—as it remains today—but was often regarded as a way of declaring ones belonging to a tradition, and therefore valued even more highly than original composition.

Recent studies have shown that computational methods can offer valuable insights into mixed authorship at the level of entire corpora [1] or major subdivisions of individual works [2, 3, 4]. However, this level of granularity may often be insufficient for solving research questions that require a more fine-grained diarization—at the paragraph or even sentence level [5]. In this context, the decade-long effort of PAN organizers to stimulate research in this direction deserves special recognition. In various forms, the style change detection task has consistently been a part of the competition’s program since 2016, making the participants’ work notes and traditional overviews published in the aftermath of these events an invaluable source of methodological insight [6, 7]. Echoing the field’s growing theoretical sophistication, for almost a decade the PAN workshops have been offering increasingly complex benchmark data and task formulations, encouraging participants to push the boundaries of achievable. 2. Related Work 2.1. Change Detection at PAN Since its first inclusion in the PAN program in 2016, task has appeared in various formulations. However, most of the factors contributing to its complexity were already present in the first two editions—namely, the required of granularity for document analysis, the uncertainty regarding the number of style changes or contributing authors, and the need to segment document. The most recent development of the task introduced only one additional—though important—dimension: controlled topic diversity in the data. 2.1.1. 2016—2022: In Search of Task’s Score At PAN 2016, the task was framed as an authorship diarization problem, closely related to the traditional intrinsic plagiarism detection explored during the early years the competition’s history [8, 9]. Participants faced three subtasks, each highlighting different challenges that were to become recurring focal points the task in the following years. The first subtask assumed a major author and required identifying segments written by secondary authors. In the second subtask, number of authors was provided, and participants were required to cluster document segments by authorship. The third and most challenging subtask involved building authorial clusters without any prior knowledge of number of authors. Operating at the sentence level, both proposed methods relied on traditional stylometric features, which were then processed using techniques typical of intrinsic plagiarism detection—namely, threshold- or Gaussian HMM-based outlier detection [10], and clustering [11]. These approaches, however, failed to achieve sufficient performance at such a fine level of granularity. The poor performance led to a redefinition the task as a style breach detection problem at PAN 2017. Instead of complete clustering a document’s segments by authorship, participants were asked to predict whether a document was written by multiple authors and, if so, to identify the points at which the writing style changes [12]. The submitted approaches again centered on distance measures and outlier detection applied to sentences as well as actual or artificially constructed paragraphs, represented using either conventional stylometric features [13, 14] or neural sentence embeddings [15]. Despite the relative improvement over 2016, the results of PAN 2017 confirmed that style-based document decomposition remained marginally beyond the state of the art at that time. Therefore, for PAN 2018, task was redefined once again, framing the problem as a document-level binary classification task. This invited participants to explore how stylistic inconsistency could be detected across an entire text [16]. The submissions reflected both conventional feature engineering --- Page 3 --- combined with rule-based or classical machine learning approaches [17, 18, 19] and early applications of deep learning [20, 21]. Ensembling multiple classifiers operating on diverse feature spaces—each capturing different aspects of language—not only proved reliable [19, 18], but also yielded the winning result [18]. The core of the classifier proposed by [21] was a CNN designed to capture patterns of character bigrams in groups of varying length. The submission by [20] deserves special attention not only because it scored second, but also because it anticipated developments in recent authorship analysis research and served as a distant source of inspiration for the approach proposed below. Instead of relying on traditional feature spaces—where lexical components took center stage at the time—[20] focused exclusively on the dependency trees of sentences. The expressiveness of this feature space has recently been confirmed in series of authorship attribution studies [22, 23, 24, 25]. [20] define and extract what they call a Parse Tree Feature (PTF)—a path from the root to any given word—and use it to represent each sentence as a sequence of its words’ PTFs, and each document sequence of sentence representations. Subsequently, both the original and reversed versions of the document are fed into an LSTM with an additional sentence-level attention mechanism, which contextualizes each sentence based on rich syntactic information across the entire problem. Finally, the similarity between and reversed representations is computed and used as the basis for prediction. Responding to performance boost observed at PAN 2018 on a simplified of the problem, the organizers of PAN 2019 increased the task’s complexity once again by adding the objective of predicting of authors per document [26]. To address this task, [27] employed a combination of clustering techniques based on representations of balanced-size text chunks obtained using the 50 most frequent words (MFW). Relying on multi-layer perceptron operating on tf-idf-weighted word unigrams detect style changes within a document, Zuo et al. subsequently used an extension of [18]’s feature extraction procedure to represent document paragraphs. They then applied an ensemble model comprising two clustering methods and multi-layer perceptron to predict of style changes. The Change Detection task at PAN 2020 was marked by two important shifts. First, after a significant departure from its originally intended scope during PAN 2018—2019, “the task was steered back into its original direction” [29, 1]. The segmentation component was reintroduced, and in addition to the document-level prediction of multi-authorship, required identify the positions where paragraph-level style changes occur. Second, for the first time, a solution based on pre-trained transformers was employed to address the task [30], significantly outperforming clustering-based approaches—the 𝐵0-maximal used by [31] and a modified version of [27], which, however, remained undocumented. PAN 2021 reintroduced yet another element of the task’s original scope that had previously been set aside as too complex: grouping of text segments by authorship within documents. The shared task presented the most complete formulation the problem, comprising three separate questions: (1) whether the text by multiple authors; (2) where between paragraphs writing style changes; and (3) which author each paragraph belongs to [32]. Although the competition saw an increasing reliance on pre-trained transformers, it marked by a wide diversity of methods. [33] proposed the highest-scoring approach for Tasks 2 and 3, using a similarity measure extracted from paragraphs with a pre-trained BERT model. They approached all tasks simultaneously, first solving 2 and 3 in an authorship verification fashion. Each paragraph was compared with all preceding ones, and a new authorial class was assigned whenever a paragraph could not be classified as written by the same author as any of the previous ones. This information was subsequently used to solve the remaining tasks. The approach by [34] excelled at Task 1. It combined sentence features extracted using BERT and aggregated per paragraphs with the set of stylometric features proposed by [18]. The tasks were solved by stacking two feature spaces and feeding them to an ensemble of four classifiers. [35] decomposed the tasks into of authorship verification problems and solved them adapting the method proposed by [36]. Other works operated over various selections stylometric features and used LSTM-powered model [37] and Siamese architecture [38] respectively. Three subtasks of PAN 2022 challenged participants with both segmentation task and granularity level. Task 1 required finding the only style shift a document co-authored by two persons. In Tasks 2 --- Page 4 --- and 3, it was necessary to find style changes in a text written by two or more authors with switches occurring at only paragraph or paragraph and sentence levels. Despite clear prevalence of pre-trained transformer-based approaches, submissions exclusively working with manually-engineered spaces and traditional classification or clustering approaches [39, 40] or combining hand-picked features with those extracted using pre-trained models were submitted [41]. One of the submissions downright “hacked” the task by accessing extrinsic information online and yielding a nearly perfect result [42]. Most submissions, however, explored different PLM-based architectures. The overall best score was achieved by [43] who obtained predictions for pairs of sentences or paragraphs by ensembling classifiers based on BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT. [44] classified pairs of sentence or paragraph representations obtained applying one-dimensional convolution and max pooling to BERT output. [45] used a prompt- based approach fine-tuning a BERT model with masked language modeling objective to predict special tokens such or in a dynamically-constructed sequence: “They are the writing style: Para1 and Para2”. [46] trained three different transformer models to address each subtask. [47] used LSTM, convolution, max pooling over BERT-based word representations. 2.1.2. 2023—2024: Strengthening Connections to Real-World Scenarios Two past shared tasks are both characterized by explicit intention to put the theoretical problem closer to real-world scenarios and addressed the problem of possible topic consistency within the documents introducing controlled levels of thematic homogeneity in benchmark data challenging participants with development of methods less dependent on thematic signal. The solutions submitted to PAN 2023 demonstrated relative difficulty of this setting. Whereas most submission achieved F1 score of more than 90% and 80% on EASY and MEDIUM tasks writing style change could coincide with thematic shift, the performance on single-topic HARD dataset was significantly lower. The year marked by further expansion of the PLMs’ use, although one solution focusing on traditional stylometry was also submitted [48]. of the important tendencies that year was a broad diversity of ways in which PLMs’s linguistic knowledge was integrated into the solutions. [49, 50] made recourse to contrastive learning in former case combining it with a prompt-based approach that excelled on the HARD dataset. [51] solved task as inference problem concatenating paragraphs and predicting special tokens or . [52] pre-trained a custom model serving as a basis for classifier, while [53] achieved highest scores and MEDIUM data using ensemble of several PLMs to predict binary labels for concatenated pairs of adjacent paragraphs. The following year’s shared task on multi-author style analysis retained the same definition and structure of benchmark data as 2023 [54], continuing the focus on paragraph-level style change de- tection with varying levels of topical homogeneity. Contrastive learning techniques and ensemble architectures based on large PLMs took an even more prominent role. As a result, overall performance improved and the gap between multi-topic and single-topic document scenarios narrowed. The best submission achieved an impressive F1 around 86% on HARD dataset. Notably, purely traditional stylome- try approaches virtually disappeared in 2024, as nearly all top relied on fine-tuned transformer models (often in combination or with specialized training objectives) to detect writing style changes. 2.1.3. Generated Text Detection in Human-AI Collaborative Hybrid Texts The surge of Generative AI has given rise to a new field of application for methods conceptually related to style change detection—authorship analysis in hybrid documents, i.e., texts co-written by humans and AI. Zeng et al. investigated the detection of AI-generated passages within human–AI collaborative texts, highlighting unique challenges of this setting: frequent author switches, obfuscation by post- editing, and the limited availability of stylistic cues in short segments. The suggested approach—a two-step segmentation and classification method augmented with modern transformers and contrastive techniques—builds directly on the foundations laid by change detection research. This hybrid document segmentation problem was also the focus of the ALTA 2024 shared task --- Page 5 --- [56], which required participants to identify AI-generated sentences in news articles. The competition demonstrated a clear methodological convergence with change detection research at PAN. 3. Methodology 3.1. Challenges of at PAN 2025 At first glance, this year’s task may appear less challenging. On the one hand, it does not require the explicit by authorship. On the other, sentence-level granularity is by no means new and has been successfully addressed in previous editions. Yet, as the organizers note, the benchmark data was designed to more accurately replicate real-world scenarios, which is why level of thematic coherence within each document was meticulously controlled [6]. Whereas the documents in the EASY dataset always cover multiple topics, the MEDIUM and HARD datasets exhibit limited or no thematic diversity, respectively. Therefore, while the first case solutions may rely on thematic clues as potential indicators of style change, the latter two—each to a different extent—force participants to rely more heavily on detecting subtle style changes rather than topic variations [6, 438]. Further shared task become evident in preliminary exploratory analysis of the benchmark data, which reveals several peculiarities of the data that significantly amplify the difficulty the task (see Appendix A): • Relatively short sentence length. • A substantial portion—over 10%—of all sentences are exact duplicates, with some occurring more than 3,000 times1. • Hundreds of sequences only contain punctuation marks, but are placed on separate lines and thus formally treated as separate sentences by the compilers of the data. Consequently, each individual sentence may not provide sufficient information for identifying author’s fingerprint and making a reliable decision. A pair of identical or nearly identical one- or two-word sentences—not only fairly common in Internet communication in general and also abundantly in the data—may be entirely style- or even content-neutral, i.e., provide no reliable clues whatsoever. 3.2. Core Intuition To address problem of such “shallow sentences”, we pivoted our approach around the idea of incorporating into the decision-making process the one thing that even the most minimalist one-word sentence always has—its context, or, in simpler terms, its position within the problem. There- fore, we designed a BiLSTM-powered solution intended to model a as a whole and capture positional dependencies between the document’s sentences treated as atomic units that are organized into stylistically cohesive segments. Our inspiration comes from late 2010s work on text segmentation and learning cohesion breaks. [57] demonstrated efficiency of bidirectional RNN trained on positive and negative examples of cohesive text in learning breaks in speech transcriptions. Further theoretical step was made by [58] who presented text topic segmentation as a supervised, specifically—sequence labeling, problem and employed to a BiLSTM powered architecture operating over sentence embeddings to implement this approach. [59]’s system, SegBot, achieved reliable performance on segmentation task at sentence and Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) level. Improving and expanding the method, [60] implemented a system segmenting texts into thematically coherent sections and assigning topic labels. Glavaš and 1The most frequently repeated sentences include moderation messages (e.g., “Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don’t attack people.”, “r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.”) and automatic notifications (e.g., “Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.”, “I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.”) --- Page 6 --- Figure 1: Pair Classifier Somasundaran and Lo et al. implemented similar contextualization approaches employing two-level transformers. The approach also has predecessors among PAN participants. Hosseinia and Mukherjee treated representations of problem’s sentences with syntactic features atomic units and explored their sequential dependencies using an LSTM. More recently, BiLSTM appeared several times as a steps in extraction or paragraph representation from PLMs [37, 47]. 3.3. Architecture To implement the idea, we opted for a lightweight solution. A problem—a sequence of sentences—is considered a single sample, and its sentences are encoded using a PLM. Applying straightforward mean pooling to token embeddings, fixed-length representations of the problem’s sentences are obtained. Then, to capture the inter-sentence contextual clues, the sequence of problem’s sentence vectors is feed into a BiLSTM. This layer outputs context-aware sentence representations enriching raw mean-pooled vectors with information from the sentences entire problem. Subsequently, by concatenating each sentence vector with adjacent one across feature dimensions, representations of sentences are constructed. These are then passed through multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier that outputs logits corresponding to the probability of a style change between each sentence pair (see Figure 1). This design enables the model to leverage both the semantic richness of the fine-tuned backbone PLM and the sequential structure the problem, resulting in robust change detection performance across documents of varying lengths and complexities. The submitted implementation code is available on GitHub2. 3.3.1. Base Transformer Different models were tested (see Table 1), but StyleDistance/styledistance, pre- sented by [63], was retained and submitted for evaluation on the test data. 4. Training 4.1. Data Augmentation To obtain more training data, we used three datasets from PAN 2024. All sentence transitions within a single paragraph were labeled as not representing a style change. The first sentence of each new paragraph was labeled as 1, indicating style change. 2https://github.com/glsch/better-call-claude_pan25-multi-author-style-analysis --- Page 7 --- Table 1 F1 scores for each model, task, and dataset configuration.

Baselines At PAN 2024, three baselines were used: RANDOM, PREDICT 1, and PREDICT 0. While using all these baselines, we decided on another—and more challenging—one, LLM, zero-shot predictions by --- Page 8 --- a best-performing LLM claude-3.7-sonnet prompted with the so-called linguistically informed prompts (LIP) [67]. For the detailed description of the baseline setup we address the reader to [68]. 6. Results The following results were obtained 2025 test data (Table 3). The gradual decline in performance from the easy to the hard tasks reflects the increasing difficulty of identifying style changes. Overall, our model outperforms zero-shot large language model predictions on both the easy and hard tasks and falls short by only a fraction of a percentage point on the medium task. At the same time, the proposed solution is lightweight and not require much computational resources. 7. Discussion Several observations stem from our approach to the PAN 2025 change detection task. First, while our model is effective, its strength lies in exploiting the macrostructure of the problem and inter-sentence contextual patterns—particularly the sequential order and distribution of sentences— rather than in isolating purely stylistic signals. This reflects a broader shift from traditional stylometric analysis, which typically assumes topical uniformity and relies on intrinsic features like syntax and lexical choice. This raises concerns about generalizability. Future iterations the task could focus more on isolation of stylistic signal by reducing contextual cues—e.g., further controlling topic coherence or randomizing sentence order—to more rigorously test a model’s ability to capture intrinsic authorial style. Second, the strong zero-shot performance of Claude draws attention to the growing impact of LLMs in authorship analysis. LLMs, with their vast pretraining and generalization capabilities, can recognize both contextual and stylistic patterns with little to no task-specific adjustment. Future PAN tasks might clearly separate evaluation tracks that allow external LLM calls from those that do not even for otherwise AI-unrelated tasks. Conclusion Despite the promising results of the proposed model, it has several limitations. First, the padding strategy required for batch processing may hinder scalability and efficiency when applied to much longer texts or inputs with highly variable lengths. Second, while the BiLSTM used for contextualization has proven effective, it may not be the optimal architecture for capturing complex dependencies, particularly in longer input sequences. More sophisticated architectures—such as those proposed by [61, 62]—could potentially yield better results. Finally, our reliance on a frozen pre-trained encoder may limit the model’s adaptability to domain- specific nuances. Fine-tuning the encoder or incorporating domain-specific data and training strategies could further improve performance.

Title: Segment First, Retrieve Better: Realistic Legal Search via Rhetorical Role-Based Queries Authors: Shubham Kumar Nigam, Tanmay Dubey, Noel Shallum, Arnab Bhattacharya Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00679v1 --- Page 1 --- Role-Based Queries Shubham Kumar Nigam1 Tanmay Dubey1 Noel Shallum3 Arnab Bhattacharya1 1 IIT Kanpur, India 2 IISER Kolkata, India 3 Symbiosis Law School Pune, India {sknigam, tanmay, arnabb}@cse.iitk.ac.in [EMAIL] Abstract Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed by the prin- ciple of stare decisis, which demands consis- tency in judicial decisions. However, the grow- ing complexity and volume of legal documents challenge traditional retrieval methods. Trac- eRetriever mirrors real-world legal search by operating with limited case information, ex- tracting only rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining initial re- sults through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking. Rhetorical annotations are gen- erated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF clas- sifier trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets, Trac- eRetriever addresses growing document vol- ume challenges while aligning with practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foun- dation for precedent retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is available. 1 Introduction The common law system’s foundation rests upon the principle stare decisis, mandating judicial adherence to precedents established in prior rul- ings when addressing analogous issues and facts within the same jurisdiction. As legal documenta- tion grows in complexity and volume, sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques be- come indispensable for understanding, analyzing, and retrieving relevant precedents. TraceRetriever plays a crucial role in upholding stare decisis, facili- tating the identification of past judgments with sim- ilar legal contexts to ensure consistent application of the law. The sheer of legal resources, in- cluding judgments, statutes, and regulations, poses a significant challenge for legal professionals seek- ing pertinent precedents, underscoring the urgent need for effective retrieval mechanisms. A notable limitation in much of the existing work on automated retrieval is its re- liance on using entire prior case documents as queries. This approach deviates significantly from real-world legal practice, where lawyers typically formulate search queries based on specific factual details and legal issues extracted from the case at hand, often with limited initial information. To address this gap, this paper tackles the challenge of mimicking legal search scenarios in TraceRetriever by proposing a novel heuristic ap- proach. Our methodology strategically integrates the complementary strengths of a keyword-based model (BM25), a semantic Database, and a fine-grained Cross-Encoder for re-ranking. A key innovation of our work lies in utilizing a trained Hierarchical Bidirectional LSTM (HierBiLSTM) model by (Bhattacharya et al., 2019) to classify sen- tences within legal documents into distinct rhetor- ical roles. We then leverage the role segments, identified through this classification, as the query for our retrieval pipeline. This deliberate use of limited, rhetorically-informed query components directly mirrors the information scarcity often en- countered in practical legal research. The core problem this paper addresses is therefore the devel- opment of a TraceRetriever system that effectively operates with limited, contextually relevant infor- mation, thereby more accurately reflecting real- world legal search processes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed TraceRetriever pipeline, we conducted experiments on two established legal datasets: the Indian Le- gal Text Understanding and Reasoning (IL-PCR) dataset (Joshi et al., 2023) and the Competition on Legal Information Extraction and Entailment (COLIEE) 2025 dataset. Our pipeline employs a heuristic approach that integrates the strengths of three distinct retrieval models: a se- mantic Vector Database, the BM25 algorithm, and a more nuanced Cross-Encoder. To further refine arXiv:2508.00679v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- At the time of the assessment proceedings, the Assessee submitted a revised computation of income by revising its claim of deduction under Section 80IA of the Act. .....The High Court refused to interfere with the Tribunals order as far as the issue on Section 80IA is concerned. .....According to him, the phrase derived from in subsection (1) of of the Act indicates that the computation of deduction is restricted only to the profits and gains from the eligible business. .....He submitted that there is no indication in subsection (5) Section 80IA that the deduction under subsection (1) is restricted to business income only. .....On the question of existence of vacancies, although learned counsel for the appellant submitted that vacancies are still lying there, which submission however has been refuted by the for the State of Rajasthan. .....The assets of the Corporate Debtor shall be managed strictly in terms of the provisions of the IBC. .....The clause reads thus 12 Miscellaneous . the Act . -Facts The is concerned. -Issue According eligible business. -Arguments of Petitioner He income only. - Arguments of Respondent On of Rajasthan. -- -Reasoning The the IBC. -Decision The Miscellaneous . -None Figure 1: Illustration of rhetorical role segmentation in a legal document.

In our approach, only relevant segments such as Facts and Issue are retained to emulate real-world legal case retrieval scenarios, where complete information like Reasoning or Decision may not be available at query time (Nigam et al., 2025). the initial retrieval results from the Vector Database and BM25, we implemented Reciprocal Rank Fu- sion (RRF), a robust re-ranking technique. In our pipeline, we established BM25 as a robust baseline, representing a tradi- tional keyword-based approach to information re- trieval. To enhance the relevance and accuracy of our results, we implemented a sophisticated re- ranking strategy that leverages both semantic un- derstanding and fine-grained interaction. Specifi- cally, we employed Cross-Encoders to re-rank the top-k documents initially retrieved by two distinct methods: the lexical matching of BM25 and the se- mantic similarity captured by our Vector Database (a bi-encoder-based approach). This multi-faceted strategy effectively of three complementary retrieval paradigms: Our key contributions are: 1. A realistic legal retrieval strategy using rhetor- ical role-based queries reflecting limited- information scenarios. 2. Development of TraceRetriever: A hybrid pipeline integrating BM25, vector search, and cross-encoder re-ranking. For the sake of reproducibility, we have made our dataset, code, and RAG-based pipeline imple- mentation via an github repository1. 2 Related Work Legal case retrieval has witnessed a rapid transfor- mation with the advent of LLMs, RAG pipelines, 1https://github.com/ShubhamKumarNigam/Legal_IR and rhetorical role labeling. Traditionally, legal in- formation retrieval relied heavily on lexical match- ing (e.g., BM25), which struggled to handle the semantic and structural nuances of legal texts. Re- cent innovations focus on improving retrieval ac- curacy by leveraging domain-specific embeddings, legal document structures, rhetorical role un- derstanding. Several systems have explored enhancing le- gal QA and retrieval using hybrid architectures. (Wiratunga et al., 2024) integrates Case-Based Rea- soning with RAG to improve contextual relevance and factual correctness in legal question-answering. Similarly, (Panchal et al., 2025) utilizes FAISS and DeepSeek embeddings to make Indian legal knowl- edge accessible through a chatbot interface. Another significant trend is the use of rhetorical roles in structuring legal texts. et al., 2019; Malik et al., 2022) pioneered rhetorical role classification in Indian legal judgments, showing that deep neural architectures such as BiLSTM- CRF and multi-task learning can outperform tradi- tional methods. (Marino al., 2023) further ad- vanced this by stacking transformers over LEGAL- BERT to capture inter-sentence dependencies for role classification across multilingual legal datasets. These works collectively demon- strate the feasibility and utility of segmenting documents into roles such as Facts, Issues, and Reasoning categories that are highly valuable for information extraction and retrieval. In recent stud- ies, al., 2019) proposed a CRF- --- Page 3 --- BiLSTM model specifically for as signing rhetori- cal roles to sentences Indian legal documents. In the context of document-to-document legal retrieval, methods like (Althammer et al., 2022), (Ma et al., 2023), and (Li al., 2023) aim to overcome the challenges of long input lengths and weak semantic relevance by employing paragraph aggregation, structure-aware pretraining, and cus- tom contrastive loss functions. Meanwhile, (Tang 2023) and al., 2024) take a graph based approach, modeling the connectivity be- tween cases via attributed case graphs or global semantic networks to achieve state-of-the-art per- formance. al., 2022) presents a cascaded retrieval framework that integrates BM25 for lex- ical matching with Sentence BERT and Sent2Vec for semantic understanding. Interestingly, results show that BM25 alone often outperforms neural models, reaffirming the robustness and relevance of lexical approaches in legal case retrieval. Beyond traditional lexical and semantic meth- ods, several recent studies have explored innova- tive architectures to enhance case retrieval by addressing challenges such as long document length, complex legal semantics, and noisy or sparse queries. (Hu al., 2022) proposes a re- trieval method grounded in legal facts by combin- ing topic modeling with BERT-based paragraph aggregation, offering more accurate semantic rep- resentations tailored to the legal domain. Similarly, (Shao et al., 2020) focuses on paragraph-level in- teractions, modeling fine-grained relationships be- tween query and candidate cases to improve rele- vance estimation using a cascade framework and BERT finetuned on legal entailment tasks. Address- ing structural and causal reasoning, (Zhang al., 2023) introduces a counterfactual graph learning approach, which transforms legal cases into graphs of legal elements and enhances retrieval via coun- terfactual data augmentation and relational graph neural networks. Meanwhile, (Zhou al., 2023) employ large language models (LLMs) to distill salient query content, showing that query reformu- lation using LLMs improves retrieval even in long, noisy legal queries. Structural reasoning is also em- phasized in SLR al., 2023), which incor- porates both internal (document segmentation into roles like Facts, Holding, Decision) and external (charge relationship graphs) structures to enhance retrieval accuracy via a learning-to-rank approach, (Santosh al., 2025) enhances prior retrieval by generating legal concepts from the factual sec- tion of a query case to capture semantic intent. Col- lectively, these works highlight a growing trend toward structurally aware, semantically enriched, and role-sensitive retrieval models supporting the need for rhetorical role-driven query formulations in legal search settings. While these systems improve retrieval through structure, semantics, or scale, few explicitly ad- dress the limited-information retrieval scenario commonly encountered real-world legal prac- tice, where queries often arise from partial knowl- edge, such as only the Facts or Issues of a case. The (Deng al., 2024) framework approaches this partially by reformulating documents into in- terpretable sub-facts using LLMs, but it does not explicitly tie these sub-facts to rhetorical roles. In contrast to general-purpose document re- trieval, al., 2023) propose U-CREAT, an unsupervised framework that extracts and matches event tuples consisting of predicates and their arguments from entire legal documents. How- ever, U-CREAT still requires parsing the full doc- ument to extract events and does not leverage ex- plicit legal segmentation such as rhetorical roles. 3 Task Description The goal of this task is to develop models capable of retrieving the most relevant prior legal cases for a given query case, with a novel emphasis on mim- icking realistic legal reasoning workflows. Unlike previous work that provides entire documents as input queries to retrieval models, we constrain the query representation by leveraging rhetorical role segmentation. This segmentation reflects how legal professionals typically reason over and search with focused portions of a case, such as facts, is- sues, or arguments, rather than the full text. Let Q = {q1, q2, . . . , qp} be a set of query legal cases, where each qi is a segmented case document composed of rhetorical roles: qi = {Factsi, Issuesi, Argumentsi, . . } Rather than passing the full qi as a monolithic document, we present the segmented roles (individ- ually or in combination) to retrieval models to en- able fine-grained relevance modeling. This design encourages the system to focus on legally salient information while ignoring irrelevant or verbose content, thus improving efficiency and interpretabil- ity. --- Page 4 --- Let D = {d1, d2, . , dn} be a corpus of prece- dent legal documents. The objective is to re- trieve a ranked list of k relevant documents Ri = {ri1, ri2, . , rik} ⊆D for each query qi, where documents are ranked by their relevance. We define a retrieval scoring function: g : Q × D →R where g(qi, dj) outputs a relevance score indi- cating the degree to which the prior legal document dj is relevant to the query qi. The retrieved list Ri for a query qi is then constructed by selecting the top k documents from D based on their relevance scores: Ri = top-k{dj ∈D | g(qi, dj) is high} The input to the system is a legal query qi, and the output is of k prior legal documents Ri, ordered by their relevance to the query. 4 Dataset To support research in the domain of Prior Case Re- trieval (PCR), we utilize the IL-PCR (Indian Legal Prior Case Retrieval) corpus, a large-scale collec- tion of Indian legal documents comprising 7,070 English-language case texts by et al., 2023). This corpus enables the development and bench- marking of retrieval systems specifically to the Indian legal system. Dataset COLIEE’25 IL-PCR # Documents 9498 7070 Avg.

The initial set comprises the 100 most-cited Supreme Court of India (SCI) 2https://indiankanoon.org/ judgments, referred to as the zero-hop set. To in- crease citation density, cases cited within these judgments (the one-hop set) were also collected. This hierarchical collection approach ensures that each document has multiple cited cases, allowing for robust retrieval evaluation al., 2023). Following standard preprocessing, empty or invalid cases were discarded. The resulting corpus was par- titioned into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) splits. 4.2 Preprocessing The preprocessing pipeline includes named entity normalization using spaCy’s NER model, along- side a manually curated gazetteer. This standard- ization improves the generalizability of learned representations. Hyperlinked citations in the doc- uments were replaced with a standardized token , while references to statutes and laws were retained, aligning with the task focus on case retrieval rather than statute retrieval. Addition- ally, an alternate version of the dataset removes entire sentences containing citations, as discussed in al., 2023). 5 Methodology This section elucidates the TraceRetriever method- ology, a multi-stage framework designed for effec- tive prior case retrieval, particularly when initiated with partial case details. Our approach integrates advanced NLP techniques, starting with rhetorical role annotation to enable targeted querying of key document sections. We then employ a hybrid re- trieval strategy, combining semantic vector search with lexical BM25 matching on a focused candi- date set. The resulting ranked lists are fused using RRF, followed by a deep semantic re-ranking via a cross-encoder. 5.1 Rhetorical Role Annotation of Legal Documents The initial stage of our methodology involves en- riching legal documents rhetorical role annota- tions at the sentence level. To achieve this, we first perform sentence segmentation using the spaCy library. We implement the BiLSTM-CRF archi- tecture introduced et al., 2019), which integrates a BiLSTM network with a Con- ditional Random Field (CRF) layer. The model takes as input sentence embeddings generated us- ing a sent2vec model trained specifically on Indian Supreme Court judgments. These embeddings are --- Page 5 --- processed by the BiLSTM to capture the sequen- tial context across sentences. The CRF layer then models the dependencies between adjacent labels, enabling the output to follow the inherent structural patterns present in legal documents. By leverag- ing contextual cues from surrounding sentences, the model assigns a rhetorical role label to each sentence in a coherent and structured manner. The output of this stage is corpus legal documents where each sentence is associated with a predicted rhetorical role, forming the foundation for subse- quent information retrieval experiments. 5.2 Vector Database Construction and Candidate Retrieval To enable efficient semantic retrieval of legal doc- uments, we employed Milvus to store and query dense vector representations. Each entry in the col- lection comprised a unique id, a 768-dimensional embedding generated using the Snowflake Arctic Embed v2.0 model, and the original document text (limited to 60,000 characters). An IVF-FLAT in- dex, configured with nlist = 2048 and using L2 distance, was built to facilitate rapid approximate nearest neighbor search. Query vectors, embedded using the same model, were matched against the collection, with the nprobe parameter controlling the search depth across partitions. The top-k se- mantically similar documents were retrieved based on L2 distance, forming the candidate set for down- stream re-ranking via cross-encoders. This stage ensures that initial retrieval captures documents with high semantic alignment to the input query. 5.3 BM25 Retrieval on Vector Database Candidates To complement semantic similarity with lexical matching, BM25 is applied but only to a reduced candidate set to avoid high computational costs. These candidates are pre-selected using vector- based retrieval, ensuring that BM25 is run only on semantically relevant documents, balancing effi- ciency and retrieval accuracy. The process begins selecting the top-k candidates from the vector search. The parameter k controls the trade-off be- tween recall and efficiency larger k may improve recall but increases computational load. We se- lected k as 1000 to maintain this balance. BM25 then scores each candidate based on term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF), rank- ing documents where rare, frequent query terms ap- pear. This yields a refined list of documents ranked by lexical relevance. By applying BM25 only to vector-selected candidates, the system enhances semantic matching with precise lexical signals. 5.4 Rank Fusion (RRF) To combine the ranked outputs from vector-based and BM25 retrieval, we employ Rank Fusion (RRF), a rank aggregation technique that leverages strengths of different retrieval methods for improved performance. Each document in the ranked lists receives a numerical rank (1 for top, 2 for second, etc.). Its reciprocal rank is computed as 1 rank+k, where k is a constant used to reduce the influence of lower-ranked re- sults. We selected an optimal k to balance influence across both retrieval methods. For each document, its reciprocal ranks across all lists are summed to generate an aggregated RRF score. Documents are then sorted in descending order of this score, producing a fused ranking that integrates both mantic similarity (from the vector DB) and lexical relevance (from BM25). RRF enhances retrieval by combining diverse signals, resulting in a more robust and accurate final document ranking than either method alone. 5.5 Cross-Encoder Re-ranking To refine the ranking of candidate documents and prioritize relevant prior cases, we use a cross-encoder model. Unlike bi-encoders used in the initial retrieval, cross-encoders attend to both the query and document simultaneously. The pro- cess begins by forming (query, document) pairs from the top results obtained via Rank Fusion (RRF). This narrows the focus to promis- ing candidates. Each pair is scored using the pre- trained bge-reranker-v2-m3 model, which excels at capturing fine-grained semantic interactions. For long documents exceeding the model’s input lim- its, a chunking strategy is applied. Each chunk is scored individually, and a final relevance score is computed using a weighted average of chunk scores. Other aggregation strategies like max or mean can also be used. Finally, documents are re- ranked based on these cross-encoder scores. yields a final ranked list where the most seman- tically relevant cases are prioritized, enhancing retrieval quality by leveraging the model’s deep understanding of query-document relations. --- Page 6 --- BM25 ranked candidates Milvus Container Vector DB ranked candidates Retrieving subset of candidates from BM25 BM25 RRF Combined ranked list Final ranked list Cross encoder Query Doc Hier- BiLSTM- CRF Segmentation of query document into rhetorical roles Querying and Retrieving candidates from vector database and milvus.

It begins by segment- ing the query legal document into sentences and classifying each rhetorical roles (e.g., Facts, Issue, Argument, Reasoning, and Decision) using a pre-trained Hierarchical BiLSTM. This segmen- tation supports role-specific querying, reflecting real-world scenarios where legal practitioners of- ten search based on partial case descriptions. To retrieve initial candidates efficiently, a bi-encoder is used to encode both the rhetorically-filtered query and documents into dense embeddings. A vector database is then queried to retrieve the top-k tically relevant documents. Since applying BM25 across the entire corpus is computationally expen- sive, it is selectively applied only to this subset of vector-retrieved documents to capture lexical overlap. To unify strengths of semantic and lexical signals, the the vector search and BM25 are merged using sion (RRF), which produces a single ranked list. Fi- nally, a cross-encoder re-ranks this list by jointly en- coding each query-document pair to compute fine- grained relevance scores. Through this multi-stage approach, TraceRetriever effectively combines se- mantic understanding, lexical precision, and deep relevance modeling addressing challenges of case retrieval under limited-information con- ditions. 6 Evaluation Metrics of our information re- trieval models, we employ a standard set of metrics commonly used in retrieval tasks. Our primary evaluation relies on Precision@k, Recall@k, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and F1@k. Precision@k quantifies the fraction of relevant documents within the top-k retrieved results, whereas Recall@k as- sesses the system’s capability to identify all rele- vant within the top-k. MAP offers an overall performance measure by averaging the pre- cision at each rank where a relevant document is found, across all queries. MRR focuses on the rank of the first relevant in the result Fi- nally, F1@k calculates the harmonic mean of Preci- sion@k and Recall@k, providing a balanced evalu- ation of both aspects. Collectively, these metrics of- fer a thorough evaluation framework for assessing the ranking effectiveness and retrieval performance of the models. Here, we introduce the results of our experiments and discuss the performance of various models. Table 2 provides a summary of evaluation metrics for every model. 7 Results Analysis Our experimental evaluation demonstrates signifi- cant variations in retrieval performance across dif- ferent query formulations based on rhetorical roles and retrieval methodologies. Table 2 presents a comprehensive comparison of precision, recall, F1- score, Precision (MAP), and Reciprocal Rank (MRR) across all experimental configurations. 7.1 Retrieval Method Performance The empirical results reveal distinct performance characteristics among the three retrieval meth- ods. BM25, a traditional lexical matching ap- proach, consistently underperforms compared to the semantic-based methods across all query con- figurations. This performance gap underscores the limitations of term-frequency based approaches --- Page 7 --- Dataset Model Precision@k Recall@k F1-score@k MAP MRR k Full Query (IL-PCR) BM25 0.0819 0.1023 0.0740 0.2116 0.2182 6 Vector DB 0.1715 0.1754 0.1419 0.3484 0.3585 5 Cross-encoder 0.1459 0.1858 0.1301 0.3480 0.3339 6 Facts (IL-PCR) BM25 0.0797 0.0835 0.0694 0.1599 0.1684 5 Vector DB 0.1093 0.1574 0.1097 0.2566 0.2783 7 Cross-encoder 0.0916 0.2050 0.1082 0.2364 0.2725 11 Facts+ Issue (IL-PCR) BM25 0.0803 0.1152 0.0800 0.1907 0.2014 7 Vector DB 0.1281 0.1606 0.1200 0.2880 0.3055 6 Cross-encoder 0.1134 0.1723 0.1143 0.2554 0.2733 7 Facts+ Issue+ Arguments (IL-PCR) BM25 0.0900 0.1328 0.0908 0.2111 0.2259 Vector DB 0.1630 0.1775 0.1418 0.3291 0.3431 5 Cross-encoder 0.1121 0.2295 0.1277 0.2680 0.3045 10 Facts+ Issue+ Reasoning (IL-PCR) BM25 0.0947 0.1034 0.0824 0.2081 0.2144 Vector DB 0.1843 0.2088 0.1636 0.3783 0.3924 5 Cross-encoder 0.1223 0.2815 0.1436 0.2973 0.3316 11 Facts+ Issue+ Decision (IL-PCR) BM25 0.0884 0.1115 0.0833 0.1864 0.1926 Vector DB 0.121 0.1747 0.1212 0.2931 0.3157 7 Cross-encoder 0.1006 0.2235 0.1179 0.265 0.2991 11 Coliee Dataset BM25 0.0549 0.1139 0.0661 0.1410 0.1440 Vector DB 0.0515 0.1795 0.0720 0.1695 0.1786 11 Cross-encoder 0.0587 0.1545 0.0754 0.1574 0.1638 8 Table 2: Performance comparison across different query configurations and models and COLIEE datasets in capturing the nuanced legal semantics present in case documents. Vector DB demonstrates su- perior performance in precision-oriented metrics, achieving the highest MAP (0.3783) and MRR (0.3924) scores with the Facts+Issue+Reasoning configuration. Notably, Vector DB consistently requires lower optimal k values (typically 5–7), indicating its strong ability to position relevant documents at higher ranks. This characteristic makes Vector DB particularly suitable for appli- cations where precision at lower ranks is priori- tized. The Cross-encoder model exhibits different performance characteristics, consistently achieving higher recall values but requiring larger k values (7–11) to reach optimal performance. For instance, the Facts+Issue+Reasoning configuration, the Cross-encoder achieves the highest recall (0.2815) among all methods but at k = 11. This suggests that Cross-encoder captures a broader range of rel- evant documents but with less precise ranking ca- pability compared to Vector DB. 7.2 Impact of Rhetorical Role Configurations The experimental results demonstrate that query formulation using specific rhetorical roles signifi- cantly impacts retrieval effectiveness. Several key observations emerge: Using only factual components (Facts) yields the lowest performance across all retrieval meth- ods, with Vector DB achieving MAP of 0.2566 and MRR of 0.2783. This finding suggests that factual information alone provides insufficient con- text for effective case retrieval. The addition of issue information (Facts+Issue) produces mod- est improvements across all models, Vector DB showing MAP of 0.2880 MRR of 0.3055. This improvement indicates that legal issues pro- vide important discriminative information beyond mere facts. When argumentative elements are in- corporated (Facts+Issue+Arguments), we observe substantial performance gains, particularly for Vec- tor DB (MAP: 0.3291, MRR: 0.3431) and Cross- encoder (Recall@k: 0.2295). suggests that arguments contain substantive information about legal reasoning that aids in identifying relevant precedents. The Facts+Issue+Reasoning config- uration consistently yields the best all retrieval methods, Vector DB achiev- ing the highest overall and MRR (0.3924). This finding highlights the critical im- portance of legal reasoning components in deter- mining case relevance. It suggests that the explicit reasoning articulated by judges forms the most dis- criminative aspect legal documents for retrieval purposes. Interestingly, incorporating the deci- sion component (Facts+Issue+Decision) results in performance degradation to the rea- soning configuration. Vector DB’s MAP decreases to 0.2931 and MRR to 0.3157, while Cross-encoder shows similar declines. This degradation may be at- tributed to the fact that decisions often contain stan- dardized language that is less discriminative than the specific reasoning that led to those decisions. The full query configuration performs relatively well (Vector DB: MAP 0.3484, MRR 0.3585), but still falls short of the Facts+Issue+Reasoning con- figuration. This indicates that using the entire doc- ument introduces noise that dilutes retrieval effec- tiveness. 7.3 Dataset Comparison A comparison between the COLIEE datasets reveals substantial performance disparities. All retrieval methods perform markedly better on the IL-PCR dataset. On the COLIEE dataset, best performance is achieved by Vector DB with MAP of 0.1695 MRR of 0.1786, substantially lower than the corresponding metrics on IL-PCR. This disparity may be attributed to differences in --- Page 8 --- document structure, domain-specific language, or the inherent complexity of the legal relationships represented in the COLIEE dataset. Additionally, our BiLSTM-based role segmentation model was on Indian legal doc- uments. 7.4 Optimal k Values context of information retrieval, k represents the number of top-ranked documents retrieved by a system. An interesting observation from our experiments is the variation in k values across different configurations. Vector DB gener- ally achieves optimal performance at lower k val- ues (5–7), while Cross-encoder typically requires higher reach optimal perfor- mance. This pattern is consistent across configurations and further emphasizes the distinct characteristics of these retrieval approaches: tor DB excels at precise ranking of highly documents within a smaller top-k set, while Cross- encoder range of potentially relevant documents, often requiring a larger top-k to include the most pertinent results due to less precise initial ranking. 7.5 Error Analysis Retrieval errors were common when queries lacked argumentative depth or rhetorical coherence. Par- tial segments like Facts or Facts+Issue often led to vague queries, reducing the ability to retrieve precise legal precedents. Cross-encoders achieved high recall but lower MAP in such settings. For example, in the Facts-only configuration (Table 2), recall was 0.205, but MAP dropped to 0.2364, indi- cating difficulty in ranking the most legally relevant documents. BM25 struggled with rhetorical overlap, particu- larly in IL-PCR, where Facts-only and Facts+Issue yielded low MAPs of 0.1599 and 0.1907. Its reliance on surface-level term frequency lim- ited its ability to distinguish semantically sim- ilar yet legally distinct content. Interestingly, dense retrieval Vector DB performed bet- ter in focused configurations. In IL-PCR, the MAP improved from 0.3484 (Full) to 0.3783 (Facts+Issue+Reasoning), likely due to reduced procedural noise and improved signal-to-noise ratio in embeddings. suggests that full-document queries, though comprehensive, may dilute dense models with irrelevant content. In contrast, se- lected rhetorical segments enhance semantic rich- ness and focus. Cross-encoders performed best when queries included Arguments or Reasoning, but struggled without structured argumentative flow. Overall, Vector DB benefited most from rhetorically rich inputs, with combinations like Facts+Issue+Reasoning offering the best trade-off between semantic depth and legal specificity. In COLIEE, absence of rhetorical segmentation degraded performance across models. DB’s dropped to 0.1695, and BM25 to 0.141, as noisy, unsegmented queries confused both dense and sparse retrievers. The rhetorical classifier, on Indian cases, also failed to generalize to Canadian judgments in COLIEE, reducing effectiveness of rhetorical-aware retrieval. 8 Conclusions and Future Work This work introduced a novel approach to case retrieval that better reflects real-world legal research, where professionals often rely partial case information like Facts and Issue. By using role segmentation to extract these com- ponents as queries, our method simulates realistic legal workflows. Evaluations on ILTUR and COL- IEE datasets showed that even under these con- straints, our pipeline BM25, VectorDB, RRF, and cross-encoder reranking retrieves relevant cases, though with reduced precision and recall compared to full-document queries. Nonetheless, this role- based querying aligns closely with how legal pro- fessionals conduct research, offering a practical shift in retrieval methodology. Our main contribu- tion is a conceptual framework for retrieval under partial information, encouraging a more practice- oriented direction in legal IR. Rather than chasing ideal scores, we aim to model realistic scenarios that support practical system design. This work has laid the groundwork for a more realistic paradigm in retrieval by focusing on the informa- tion actually available at the initial stages of legal research. Our findings underscore the viability of a pipeline role segmentation for query formulation, demonstrating effective, albeit reduced, retrieval performance compared to meth- ods relying on complete case documents. Future work includes improving retrieval robustness under sparse queries, enhancing rhetorical segmentation, and testing advanced rerankers. We also aim to explore cross-lingual and multi-domain retrieval to further bridge academic research and real-world legal use cases. --- Page 9 --- Limitations While this work presents retrieval that legal research, several limitations remain and highlight directions for improvement. A key challenge is the semantic sparsity of queries constructed from only rhetorical roles and Issue. This constrained input can omit important context, limiting the models’ ability to fully capture legal reasoning and reduc- ing retrieval precision. Rhetorical overlap between Facts and Reasoning poses another issue. Their linguistic similarity makes it difficult especially for models like BM25 to differentiate cases based solely on rhetorical cues. While cross- encoders and vector models mitigate this to some extent, they still struggle with nuanced legal dis- tinctions. Class imbalance in rhetorical roles also affects performance, particularly for underrepre- sented roles like Issue or Decision. Additionally, the computational complexity of advanced mod- els like cross-encoders and dense retrievers can hinder scalability. Their high resource demands may limit deployment in real-world systems. Fu- ture work should explore optimization techniques such as pruning or quantization to maintain perfor- mance with lower resource requirements. While the system shows promise under real-world con- straints, addressing these limitations will be crucial for building scalable and robust legal retrieval sys- tems.

This article explores the zero-shot performance of state-of- the-art large language models (LLMs) on one of the most challeng- ing tasks in authorship analysis: sentence-level style change detection. Benchmarking four LLMs on the official PAN 2024 and 2025 “Multi- Author Writing Style Analysis” datasets, we present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are sensitive to variations in writing style—even at the granular level of individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline for the task, outper- forming suggested baselines of the PAN competition. Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously re- ported. Keywords: AI-assisted authorship analysis · style change detection · language models · analysis · semantic similarity 1 Introduction Style change detection is the most challenging problems within the broader field of authorship analysis, with numerous academic and industrial applications ranging from philological and historical research to anti-plagiarism, copyright protection, forensics, cybersecurity, and governance. It is hardly a coincidence, therefore, that specific instances of this problem—such as author diarization or multi-author style analysis—have been featured among the PAN shared tasks since 2016, longer than any other task. Approaches to this task primarily relied on feature engineering and clas- sical machine learning and, more recently, deep learning methods, especially pre-trained model based solutions. Despite the ever-increasing quality and per- formance of these models, developing and using such systems has become pro- hibitively expensive, requiring large amounts of rare labeled data and advanced arXiv:2508.00680v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- 2 Römisch et al. technical expertise. At the same time, these systems are often difficult to interpret— an important limitation for many use cases, particularly in academic research within the humanities and social sciences, as well as in forensic applications. The release of a pleiade of LLMs since 2022 is believed to have shifted the paradigm. Trained on extensive corpora, these models can detect even subtle regularities in texts, resulting in impressive performance in text generation and a variety of other downstream tasks. In the of authorship analysis too, LLMs gave birth to entirely new fields of analysis, and the wave of enthusiasm among scholars suggests that LLMs are expected to soon bridge the efficiency of deep learning systems and the need for interpretability. Aiming to contribute to a better understanding of LLMs as tools for author- ship analysis and to encourage their adoption, we present an analysis of their performance on style change detection—a subfield authorship analysis in which the capabilities of LLMs have so far remained underexplored. 1.1 Task Definition The core task of detection is to determine whether a given text was written by multiple authors and, if so, to identify the positions at which authorship changes occur4. 1.2 Goals The first goal of this article is to survey state-of- the-art generative AI models on the task. Our second objective is to explore various factors that influence the models’ predictions. We use the Hamming distance as a measure of response correctness and examine its correlation with parameters of the problems (e.g., number of authors, number of changes, length of the problem) and their semantic features. 2 Related Work 2.1 Style Change Detection In early editions of PAN, the task was approached through manual and corpus- specific engineering of stylistic features subsequently used for unsupervised clus- tering of predefined text segments [27, 22, 7, 13]. Since the late 2010s, method- ologies shifted towards neural networks [2], and by 2023, transformer-based ar- chitectures dominated approaches presented at PAN. Leveraging rich linguistic knowledge from pre-training on massive corpora, transformer backbones consistently achieve exceptional performance, regularly 4 The task can be formulated at different levels of granularity (sentence, paragraph, etc.), but can also be presented as a clustering problem. --- Page 3 Writing Style? 3 surpassing 80% accuracy even on challenging datasets with uniform topic sig- nal. Apart from traditional classification [8, 18], particularly popular strategies include contrastive learning [34, 32, 31], ensembling of models fine-tuned on var- ious aspects of style. Less conventional yet insightful methodologies also were presented by employ- ing manually-constructed prompts with masked language modeling [37]; Gao et al. [4] openly “hacked” the task using extrinsic web clues. Additionally, closely related tasks such as detecting AI-generated or Human- AI co-authored texts share these methodologies well as boundary detection and segment-level attribution. For instance, [35] introduced a modular frame- work combining segment detection with sentence-level classification using var- ious Transformer architectures [36, 19, 9, 38], while GigaCheck [28] combined sentence-level binary classification with DETR-style character-level span pre- diction for detailed LLM attribution. Other recent approaches have exploited structural and attributional signals beyond superficial content, such as Top- Former’s integration of topological features via Topological Data Analysis (TDA) [29], persistent homology derived from attention maps [15], and token-level log- probability dynamics aggregated through CNN and self-attention mechanisms [30]. These methods, especially those focused on stylometric shifts, segmentation, or local attribution, are readily adaptable to change detection. 2.2 AI-assisted Authorship Analysis The surge of GenAI birth to a new field within authorship analysis— AI-assisted authorship analysis. New LLM-based methodologies emerged using LLMs for feature extraction, data augmentation, and direct stylistic analysis [11]. Relying on the robust abilities of LLMs to describe writing styles, [21] intro- duced a system producing interpretable style embeddings. Similarly, [23] used GPT-4-Turbo to generate structured stylistic descriptions as training data for a smaller Llama-3-8B model, enhancing interpretability. Directly prompting LLMs with authorship-related queries, [10] and [26] re- port promising reliability in authorship verification, although the latter high- lights potential bias due to semantic similarity in historical languages. Explicitly guiding models with linguistically-informed prompts (LIP) notably boosts per- formance and analytical quality, particularly in English texts [10]. The Promp- tAV framework similarly directs LLMs through stylometric reasoning author- ship tasks [12]. Our experiment thus aligns with broader explorations of LLM capabilities in authorship analysis, contributing specifically to the niche but increasingly relevant task of change detection. --- Page 4 --- 4 et al. 3 Methodology 3.1 Zero-Short Prompting Given the proven effectiveness of zero-shot prompting strategies in various tasks[14, 24], including those involving complex reasoning and style-based predictions, we also adopted a zero-shot approach in our experiments, prompting the models with a “problem”—a sequence of sentences—and a task: predict style changes occurring in pairs of adjacent sentences (0-1, 1-2, etc.). Following the insights from the literature emphasizing that the carefully engineered prompts are essen- tial for high-quality output [25], we tailored ours in two ways. First, after initial experiments with minimal prompt, we tried to employ what can be described as “strategic guessing”. We began by establishing random baselines5 and carefully exploring the data identify the strategies that could improve the models’ odds independently of actual textual content. It turned out that hypothesizing 3 or 4 authors (that is, 2 or 3 style switches per problem) would cover most cases in the data (see Figure 1 in Appendix B). Therefore, our prompt (see Appendix A) included an explicit recommendation to assume that there are “approximately 3” authors in the problem. We then trained an XGBoost classifier to predict the number of authors (see Appendix B) and injected its output into the prompt, but it overwhelmingly predicted three authors. As a result, there was no significant performance difference between the static prompt and the dynamic, classifier-driven prompt. Table 1. Random and constant baselines. Baseline F1 (macro) all changes 0.1570 no changes 0.4426 3 random changes 0.4946 4 random changes 0.4982 The second axis of our prompting strategy involved providing explicit instruc- tions about the stylistic features expected to be useful for distinguishing between authors6. For contemporary and well-resourced languages, at least, such a strat- 5 Random baselines consist of three trivial strategies: never predicting an author change, always predicting a change at every boundary, and randomly selecting a fixed number of change points (e.g. 1, 2, or 3). F1 macro was computed for each strategy, see Table 1. 6 Our prompt contained the following addition: “Analyze the writing styles of the input texts, disregarding the differences in topic and content. Base your decision on linguistic features such as: phrasal verbs; modal verbs punctuation; rare words; affixes; quantities; humor; sarcasm; typographical errors; misspellings.” --- Page 5 Writing Style? 5 egy has been reported to be beneficial [10]7, which builds on the conceptual framework outlined in [5]. 3.2 Measure of “Correctness”: Hamming Distance To assess the factors influencing model predictions within a single problem, one needs a measure to quantify how closely the predicted sequence of author change labels matches the ground truth. Hamming distance is a metric used to measure the difference between two strings of equal length. It is defined as number of at which the corresponding symbols differ. This makes it particularly suitable for evaluating the overall correctness of a model’s output in sentence- level style change detection, where each sentence is assigned an author label. For easier interpretation and cross-problem comparison, we use the normalized Hamming distance, obtained by dividing the raw distance by the total number of sentences. A lower value indicates higher prediction accuracy, while a value of zero denotes a perfect match with ground truth. 3.3 Measure of Semantic Similarity With a clear indicator of overall prediction accuracy for individual problems, we further correlation with various measures of semantic similar- ity within each problem. We used sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and styleDistance/styledistance to vectorize the sentences and compute the semantic similarity and correlations. Specifically, we consider several related metrics: 1. Average cosine similarity of sentences within a problem; 2. average similarity of pairs with an author switch; 3. similarity of adjacent pairs; 4. mean pairwise cosine distance within a problem. 3.4 Data To ensure the comparability of our results with existing approaches, we rely on the widely recognized evaluation framework of PAN and used their official “Multi-Author Style Analysis” datasets from 2024 and 2025. The data consists of lists of sentences (such lists are called “problems”) and arrays of binary labels for each pair adjacent sentences the problem. The texts represent continuous discussions in Reddit threads. 2025 data is divided into sentences, while 2024 into paragraphs. Both datasets are served at three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard, each split into train (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets. In this study, all exploratory work is done on train set, while validation is only used for prompting LLMs. 7 However, it remains an open question whether this approach retains its effectiveness when applied to historical languages [26]. With reservations, own research suggests the opposite. --- Page 6 --- 6 et al. 3.5 Models & Experiments Our experiment comprises three stages. In the first stage, we randomly sample 250 problems from the validation splits of three datasets and submit them as prompts to state-of-the-art models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek-R1, and Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct. In the second stage, we prompt the en- tire splits of each dataset (900 problems) to the best-performing model identified in the first stage. In the third stage, having obtained predic- tions from that model, we compute the Hamming distance, semantic similarity, and correlations as described above. 4 Results The results of the first evaluation stage are summarized in Table 2. Among the evaluated models, Claude-3.7-Sonnet consistently outperformed its competitors— GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct—across all difficulty lev- els and despite the distinct characteristics of the three datasets (see Appendix B). Even in the zero-shot setting, the model’s reasoning allowed it to achieve com- petitive accuracy. Table 3 presents detailed performance metrics for the best- Table 2.

To contextualize Claude’s performance, we fine-tuned a styleDistance/styledistance transformer combined with an LSTM and MLP (127m) for adjacent sentence classification using combined 2024 and PAN 2025 training data8. Remarkably, Claude’s zero-shot prompting performance nearly surpasses that of the fine-tuned transformer on the medium dataset and remains close behind on the other two. These results align with additional obser- vations made on the PAN 2024 paragraph-level style-change dataset, we simply adapted the prompt by replacing the term “sentence” with “paragraph”. There, Claude achieved a score of 0.618 on the hard dataset, outperforming not only baseline models but also four official submissions [1]. Unsurprisingly, Claude’s results on easy and medium datasets were even more impressive, reaching 0.83. 8 For training we used the paragraph-level annotations to generate labeled pairs by splitting paragraphs into adjacent units, treating them as sentence-like segments. This allowed us to augment the data and obtain style-change labels between pairs. --- Page 7 Writing Style? 7 Table 3. Performance of claude-3.7-sonnet on full validation data the three tasks.

Measuring Hamming distance us to examine how prediction accuracy is influenced by various problem-level parameters. Table 4 presents correlations between Hamming distance and four parameters: of authors per problem, number of actual author changes, number of predicted changes, and number of problem. The of predicted changes shows a strong positive correlation with Hamming distance across three datasets. This indicates that the more style changes Claude predicts—whether correctly or not—the more likely it is to de- viate from ground truth. This suggests this tendency of the model to over- segment is a key source of error. of actual style changes is only weakly correlated with Hamming distance, and significantly so only in the and medium datasets. This indi- cates that the intrinsic complexity of the text (in terms of true author switches) only slightly contributes to model confusion, that the local stylistic context may play a bigger role than the dynamics in the problem in general. The medium dataset stands out as particularly challenging. The correlation between predicted changes and distance is strongest here, and the cor- relation with of authors is also positive and significant, unlike easy and hard sets. This suggests that the medium dataset, while not explicitly labeled as most difficult, may contain greater internal variance—particularly in the number and distribution of authors—leading to less reliable prediction. In sum, these correlations seem to bring to light that prediction errors are less a function of the data complexity and more a result of the model’s internal heuristics—especially its tendency to overpredict change points. These findings suggest that there probably remains a room for improvement of the and the entire pipeline, which the LLM will be a crucial but not only participant. 5.2 Correlation between style change and semantics A comparison between correlations of semantic similarity with predicted and true authorship changes reveals a striking pattern. Importantly, note that a predicted value of 1 indicates a change of author, which is expected to correspond to low cosine similarity between adjacent sentences; conversely, value of 0 (no change) should align with high similarity. Therefore, a negative correlation implies that --- Page 8 --- 8 et al. Table 4. Correlation Hamming distance of predicted vs. actual style switches and problem-level parameters.

Across all models, we observe a moderate to strong correlation on the easy split, suggesting that stylistic shifts are often accompanied by semantic diver- gence in simpler cases. However, this correlation becomes much weaker or disap- pears entirely the hard split, indicating that in more complex texts, stylistic changes do not always show as measurable differences in sentence embeddings, see Table 5. Moreover, in the ground truth, the interesting trend is observed in harder cases: authorship changes often occur between semantically similar sen- tences, possibly due to topic continuity or deliberate stylistic imitation.

This decision was informed by a statistical analysis the PAN datasets, which revealed that the majority --- Page 9 Writing Style? 9 of documents contain between two and four (see Appendix B, Figure 1). However, we acknowledge that this heuristic is highly dependent on the specific distribution the PAN data. When applying the same approach to corpora from other domains—such as literary texts, social media outside Reddit, or historical documents—it would be necessary to conduct a similar exploratory analysis to determine an appropriate prior. While effective in our case, such assumptions should be treated as dataset-specific and not be blindly generalized across tasks. 5.4 LLMs: A Baseline for PAN? An important consideration in interpreting our results is the source of the data. The documents used in this task originate from Reddit, a platform whose content has probably been extensively represented in the training of the LLMs. This raises the possibility that the models, despite being used as black boxes, may benefit from prior exposure to the domain and its stylistic conventions. However, rather than undermining our findings, this observation reinforces a central claim of our study: LLMs perform surprisingly well on the multi-author change detection task in a zero-shot setting, relying solely on prompt-based guidance and without any task-specific fine-tuning. On this basis, we argue that LLMs should be regarded as a strong and competitive baseline for this task. This observation, in turn, raises broader questions about task design. If the goal is to rigorously assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, particularly in unfamiliar stylistic or genre contexts, future benchmarks may need to draw on curated or out-of-domain sources. Historical corpora, literary texts, or non- mainstream digital genres could provide more robust tests of the models’ true stylistic sensitivity, independent of memorization or domain familiarity. 5.5 Hallucinations LLMs are increasingly optimized to minimize hallucinations. Prominent mod- els such as GPT and Claude incorporate internal safety mechanisms aiming at ethical alignment and factual reliability. While these safeguards are not always thoroughly documented in technical papers, they can be broadly understood as a set of training procedures and architectural decisions geared towards reducing harmful, irrelevant, or incorrect outputs. A central component of these efforts is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [16, 20], which plays a critical role in aligning model behavior with human preferences, including truthfulness and ethical reasoning. This align- ment process has been shown to reduce hallucinations and improve the model’s ability to reference factual content with greater accuracy. Recent research has begun to explore the extent to which LLMs can attribute their outputs to external sources—a capability closely related to hallucination minimization. For example, et al. [3] introduce ALCE, a benchmark for evaluating citation quality in LLM-generated answers. ALCE combines metrics for fluency, factuality, and attribution across QA datasets. Similarly, AttrScore --- Page 10 --- 10 et al. [33] offers a framework for evaluating whether model-generated claims are sup- ported by cited references, using classification labels such as attributable, ex- trapolatory, and contradictory. This approach integrates both prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and is validated on both synthetic and real-world Bing search outputs. Further, a comprehensive survey by Li et al.[17] reviews existing techniques for tracing LLM outputs back to source materials, presenting an overview of available datasets, evaluation metrics, error typologies, and outstanding chal- lenges in grounding generated content in verifiable evidence. Complementary to this, Guo et al.[6] propose a unified framework for automated fact-checking, encompassing claim detection, evidence retrieval, verdict prediction, and justifi- cation generation, along with a systematic review of associated resources. It is reasonable to hypothesize that a model’s attribution capability may correlate with its hallucination rate, with stronger grounding mechanisms con- tributing to reduced factual errors. However, validating this hypothesis is dif- ficult due to several factors: the proprietary nature of leading LLMs, limited transparency in model architecture and training data, and the lack of standard- ized, robust benchmarks for hallucination detection in state-of-the-art systems. This remains a critical limitation for future research, especially in high-stakes applications requiring verifiability and trustworthiness. References 1.

In the mental health sector, particularly in psychiatry, there has been a paradigm shift, with a growing focus on understanding the brain and the underlying mechanisms that regulate behavior, emotions, and responses to external or internal changes. Despite these advances, psychiatric diagnosis still faces significant challenges due to the subjective and complex nature of the symptoms presented by patients, as well as the frequent overlap between different mental disorders. Moreover, despite the progress made in the field of medicine, the number of patients suffering from mental disorders has not decreased but has instead increased since 2019, when 970 million people were living with a mental disorder (World Health Organization, 2022a). The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned not only about these numbers but also about the increase in mental disorders diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases of anxiety disorder rising by an estimated 26% Health Organization, 2022b). In field of mental healthcare, two major disciplines coexist: psychology and psychiatry. Although The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the perfor- mance of various Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT and SciBERT), to classify notes into these two diagnoses. Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling, Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), to assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling techniques had minimal on model performance overall. The only exception was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models. However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The Decision Tree eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model performance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted diagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of different model architectures and data balancing methods. --- Page 2 --- 2/20 they share the common goal of improving mental well-being, they differ significantly in their training, methods, and approaches to treatment. Psychology is the scientific study of mental processes and behavior, including both internal mental activities, such as thoughts and emotions, and externally observable behaviors (Henriques and Michalski, 2020). Psychological practice primarily involves therapeutic methods based on dialogue and behavioral interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, humanistic therapy, or psychodynamic approaches. These treatments focus on modifying dysfunctional behaviors, emotions, and thoughts, typically following a non-medical model. Psychiatry, by contrast, is a branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Psychiatrists, as medical doctors, are trained to assess both psychological symptoms and their biological underpinnings. They can prescribe pharmacological treatments and often manage complex cases involving severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, or severe anxiety disorders (Kendler et al., 2011). While psychology and psychiatry approach mental health from different perspectives—psychology focusing more on psychological and social aspects, psychiatry integrating biological, psychological, and pharmacological considerations—the two disciplines are complementary and increasingly collaborate in interdisciplinary mental health teams to provide holistic patient care. While psychological conditions often involve significant distress, psychiatric disorders may pose more serious risks to patients’ lives, including an increased risk of suicide. Moreover, it has been extensively documented that individuals suffering from severe mental disorders frequently experience reduced life expectancy. For example, people diagnosed with schizophrenia have an estimated life expectancy that is 10 to 20 years shorter than that of the general population (Nimavat et al., 2023). In addition, many individuals with mental illnesses face a substantial treatment gap, with only 29% of those with psychosis and 33% those with depression receiving formal mental health care Health Organization, 2021; Moitra et al., 2022). These challenges highlight the pressing need for innovative approaches to support mental healthcare systems and improve access and quality of care. One of the biggest problems for people suffering from a mental illness when seeking help from a public psychologist or psychiatrist is the long waiting time to get an appointment. Timely access to professionals would help patients receive a diagnosis and appropriate treatment for their condition. However, to the lack of human and economic resources, as the time required get an appointment, we propose a solution aimed at reducing the workload in the of clinical notes, also known as electronic health records (EHR). It has been shown that artificial intelligence (AI) models have helped in various medical fields. For example, in oncology, AI has become a valuable tool for predicting cancer (Liu et al., 2020; Alanazi, 2023; Briganti and Le Moine, 2020). Additionally, AI continues to be useful in predicting cancer recurrence (Zhang al., 2023). Some AI models based on images have been used to detect different types of cancer, such as skin, breast, and lung cancer (Midasala et al., 2024; Kaka et al., 2022; Quanyang et al., 2024). In other medical fields, AI has contributed significantly to improving outcomes, such as in the detection of diabetes in patients (Wu, 2024). However, AI models are not limited to using a single type of input, such as images; they can also process text as a source of information. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques help extract meaningful information from types of texts. Among the goals of NLP is predicting whether a person suffers from a particular illness. This approach has been applied, for example, in using AI to predict whether a patient has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), achieving nearly 90% accuracy (Rubio- Mart´ın al., 2024). Another study related to AI and psychiatry involved classification of texts about eating disorders (ED) into four categories—texts written by someone with ED, texts that promote ED, informative texts, and scientific texts—achieving nearly 87% accuracy in one of the categories (Ben´ıtez-Andrades al., 2022). Delving specifically into the convergence between psychiatry and AI, several studies have attempted to assist in the diagnosis or classification of complex mental disorders, as schizophrenia, depression, or anxiety disorders, using AI (Kodipalli and Devi, 2023; Cortes-Briones al., 2022; ALSAGRI and YKHLEF, 2020; Nemesure et al., 2021). As shown, applying NLP techniques can help extract relevant information from unstructured data, such as EHRs. The use of EHRs as input for AI has led to the development of models capable of predicting depression crises in patients (Msosa 2023). In recent years, these efforts have been further expanded in multiple directions. For instance, the prediction of anxiety symptoms in social anxiety disorder has been achieved using multimodal data --- Page 3 --- 3/20 collected during virtual reality sessions (Park et al., 2025). In another line of work, deep learning models have been developed that outperform clinicians in identifying violence risk from emergency department notes (Dobbins al., 2024). Transformer-based models have also been employed to detect personal and family history of suicidal ideation in EHRs, yielding F1-scores above 0.90 (Adekkanattu al., 2024). Furthermore, suicide risk has been phenotyped using multi-label classification strategies based on psychiatric clinical notes (Li al., 2024). of the most challenging scenarios in AI-driven classification involves EHRs, where patients are diagnosed with various mental disorders that share overlapping symptoms. The differentiation between anxiety disorders (ICD-10 F41) and adjustment disorders (ICD-10 F43) is key in the clinical appropriate treatment of patients. Both disorders can present anxious symptoms, but these play a different role in each case. In anxiety disorders (F41), anxious symptoms are central and form part of the core clinical picture. Examples of these disorders include generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. Anxiety in these cases does not require a specific external triggering event; that is, the person may experience excessive and ongoing worries about various aspects of life without a clear precipitating factor Health Organization, 2019). On the other hand, adjustment disorders (F43) are characterized by the presence of an identifiable life event or stressor that triggers the symptoms, which may include anxiety, depression, or behavioral changes. These symptoms are a disproportionate psychological response to a stressful situation, such as the loss of a loved one, divorce, or work-related difficulties, and they are time-limited. Unlike anxiety disorders, symptoms in adjustment disorders tend to resolve when the individual adjusts to the new situation or the stressful event is resolved. While anxiety disorders present anxious symptoms as a central element and do not rely on a clear external trigger, adjustment disorders always have an identifiable stressful event that precipitates the symptoms. This differentiation is fundamental to guide both diagnosis and therapeutic decisions. The importance of distinguishing between these two types of disorders is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis, as clinical interventions for each may differ significantly. A misdiagnosis or confusion between the two could lead to inappropriate treatments, negatively affecting the patient’s prognosis (Casey and Bailey, 2011). For classification purposes, we grouped all ICD-10 codes under the F41 category (Other anxiety disorders) into a single “anxiety disorder” class. This includes panic disorder or episodic paroxysmal anxiety (F41.0), anxiety disorder (F41.1), mixed anxiety disorders (F41.3), other specified anxiety disorders (F41.8), and unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). Although our approach focuses on analyzing and classifying existing clinical notes rather than intervening during the initial diagnostic process, structuring and interpreting this information has substantial value. Enhanced documentation quality, retrospective clinical audits, improved training datasets for future models, and support for research activities are some of the ways in which structured clinical information can meaningfully contribute to the mental healthcare system without altering the core diagnostic workflows. Due to the challenges involved in classifying these two mental disorders, this research demonstrates how AI can achieve highly accurate classification of EHRs, specifically aiming to identify patients diagnosed with adjustment disorder or anxiety disorder. Additionally, this manuscript presents several substantial advancements. The key contributions of this research include: • Machine learning models: We trained several machine learning models in pursuit of the best results. To optimize the performance of each model, a hyperparameter tuning process was carried out. The implementation of this tuning process helped to improve the initial results. • BERT-based models: We explored BERT models, testing two separate pretrained versions, each with distinct training datasets and features that influenced their effectiveness in our tasks. • Data balancing process: Although the dataset is sufficiently large to evaluate the metrics each model, we applied two data balancing techniques, known as Random Oversampling Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). These techniques were used to assess whether increasing number of samples in the dataset would allow the models to leverage additional characteristics that could improve the classification task. • Real medical dataset: For this research, clinical notes were provided by the ’Complejo Asisten- cial Universitario de Leo´n’ (CAULE). This dataset contains health records of patients --- Page 4 --- 4/20 with adjustment and anxiety disorders. The dataset is entirely self-created, giving it unique value and relevance. From its initial design and data collection to its cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation, every step was meticulously handled to align with goals of this research. By controlling the entire data treatment process, we gained a deep understanding of the dataset’s structure, limitations, and potential insights. This level of control allows for highly tailored analyses and more reliable results. the challenges and restrictions in obtaining clinical notes or other patient information, this dataset holds significant scientific value. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2, ’Material and Methods’, provides a detailed descrip- tion of the methodology applied, including the collection and preprocessing of the dataset. Section 3, ’Experiments and Results’, outlines the experiments conducted and presents the findings, along with a comparison of the various models used. Lastly, Section 4, ’Discussion and Conclusions’, brings together the discussion and conclusion to create a unified narrative. 2 MATERIAL AND METHODS This section a detailed explanation the methodology implemented throughout the research. Firstly, section 2.1 describes the process followed to obtain the dataset and how it was transformed from unstructured to structured data. Next, section 2.2 presents the models implemented for this research. Additionally, section 2.3 outlines the hardware and software specifications of the computer used for the research. 2.1 Dataset collection and classification All research involving patient information requires time and the ability to overcome several challenges that arise throughout the process. To begin with, patients’ EHRs contain highly sensitive information, which must be protected under strict privacy regulations, as mandated by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (European Parlament, 2016). Since patient identification is not required for this research, the notes were anonymized to allow the EHRs as a valuable information source, not only in the medical field but also field of artificial intelligence (Rao al., 2023). An ethics committee was convened and granted us permission to use Spanish as a dataset for research purposes, ensuring that no patient could be identified. This approval was issued by the Research Ethics Committee for Medicinal Products of the Health Areas of Leo´n and Bierzo under the identifier 2303. The EHRs consist clinical notes from the psychiatry unit of CAULE, written entirely in plain text without any structured data. The dataset comprises 12,921 clinical notes, collected between January 11, 2017, and December 31, 2022. All notes were collected from the Psychiatry Emergency Service of the hospital. Each note documents an urgent psychiatric assessment performed during an emergency department visit. These notes are not part of scheduled outpatient consultations or longitudinal inpatient records, but rather correspond to acute episodes requiring immediate attention. Depending on the evaluation, the patient is either discharged (often with referral for outpatient follow-up) or admitted to inpatient care. Therefore, each note is self-contained and part of a progressive sequence of visits. This research was supported by professional psychiatrists who assisted in creating structures to organize the information found in the EHRs. Additionally, these experts provided several guidelines for processing the data. The first step in dataset preprocessing was to remove samples or records where the clinical note was either empty or not properly completed. To avoid including clinical notes that lacked sufficient or valuable information due to their short length, the experts decided not to consider clinical notes shorter than 600 characters. This threshold was not arbitrary but carefully determined, as it was found that many samples under 600 characters lacked the necessary information to begin structuring the data. Moreover, it was calculated that applying this threshold retained almost 95% of the dataset while that no clinical notes with insufficient information were included, as shown in Figure 1. Continuing with the preprocessing phase, the first data extracted from the EHRs were the patient’s age and gender. To achieve this, regular expressions were used. A preview the dataset revealed various patterns that allowed for the extraction of most patients’ ages. All phrases structured like ’20 years old man’ and ’30 years old woman’ among other possibilities, were captured using a complex regular expression. --- Page 5 --- 5/20 Figure 1. Distribution of the mean clinical note length (in characters) per patient. The green area shows that of the patients have an average note length above the 600-character threshold applied. CIPA AN are the patients ID. Moreover, the expressions were designed to account for common human writing errors, such as missing or extra spaces between words, well as misspelled words, ensuring the correct extraction of the patient’s age. The task of extracting the patient’s gender was partially accomplished using the same regular expression, as ’Man’ and ’Woman’ directly refer to male and female, respectively. However, in some cases, extracting gender is more challenging, as in clinical notes where the term ’Patient’ is used instead of gender-specific terms like ’Man’ or ’Woman’. In these instances, past participle verb forms in Spanish used to infer the patient’s gender. Additionally, when these verbs were absent, marital status indicators like ’single’ or ’married’, which have gender-specific forms in Spanish, were leveraged to help determine patient’s gender. The new dataset now consists of several columns. The first column contains the original clinical note. The second contains the patient’s gender, represented as ’V’ for male and ’M’ for female. The third column records patient’s age. Since the clinical notes are plain texts written by professionals summarizing the interview with the patient, the EHRs try to follow the Subjective-Objective- Assessment-Progress (SOAP) standard. However, in this dataset, the information for each section is not clearly delineated, and the majority of notes are composed as unstructured narratives rather than strictly segmented reports. As a result, identifying the actual diagnosis from these notes is not straightforward. Diagnostic terms such as “anxiety” or “adjustment disorder” may appear in different parts of the note — for instance, in the personal or family history, in symptom descriptions, or as part of comorbidities — without necessarily representing the primary diagnosis. Additionally, anxiety is frequently recorded as a symptom within broader diagnostic categories, adding semantic ambiguity. For these reasons, we did not remove diagnostic terms from clinical notes during preprocessing. This choice was deliberate, as our aim was to evaluate whether the model could correctly infer the diagnosis based on context, even in presence of potentially misleading or overlapping terms. The initial goal of this approach was to extract diagnoses from each clinical note. achieve this, a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT 4.0, was utilized, as it has proven to be a powerful tool for information extraction in various research studies (Wang al., 2023). research, the ChatGPT API, accessed through Microsoft Azure services, was employed to process 1,000 clinical notes. Prompt engineering techniques, including use of different roles in API requests (Garc´ıa-Barraga´n --- Page 6 --- 6/20 et al., 2024), were applied to enhance the model’s performance. Figure 2. Representation of the prompt structure. One such technique was Few-Shot learning, which involves assigning the model a specific role, explaining the task objective, breaking the task into multiple steps, and providing correct examples of how the task should be performed. This approach ensures that the model understands how to execute the task effectively. Several scientific publications emphasize the value of this Few-Shot prompt engineering technique when working with ChatGPT. In this case, the ChatGPT 4.0 model, which can handle up to 32,000 tokens of conversational context, was used. Since notes are written in Spanish, the prompt was constructed in Spanish; however, for ease of understanding in this paper, the prompt will be presented in English. The API request format is in Figure 2. The prompt structure is explained below: • ROLE: The role assigned to the model. This instruction helps the model adopt an appropriate perspective, focusing on knowledge relevant to the designated role. case, the role given was: ’You are an assistant and a linguist specialized in identifying entities within text. You are a leading expert in psychiatry, and I need your help with a very important task in medicine’. • TASK and INSTRUCTIONS: The objective of the task is explained to the model, outlining how it should proceed and detailing how special situations should be handled. Furthermore, the process is broken down into a list of instructions that can be easily followed by the model, as the main problem is split into smaller, manageable tasks. • CLINICAL NOTE 1: Corresponds to the first clinical note provided as plain text. • CORRECT ANSWER GIVEN: A sample of a correct answer is provided to the model for first clinical note. This example the model understand how to proceed. this case, it was specified the model should label the diagnosis as ’DX’ during entity extraction, using ’@@’ to indicate the start of the extraction and ’##’ indicate the end of the diagnosis extraction. One example correct answer given would be ’DX @@ Ansiedad reactiva, Sindrome ansioso-depresivo ##’. CLINICAL NOTE 2: The next note the model to continue the task. The final results by the LLM were reviewed by experts. After completing the entire preprocessing process, we focused on those notes where patients were diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder or any form of Anxiety Disorder. For this line of research, which centers on two mental --- Page 7 --- 7/20 Figure 3. Demographic data from the patients the clinical notes.

Percentage distribution by gender and complete age statistics by diagnosis. (Std = Standard Deviation) disorders, a total of 228 notes were considered: 82 corresponding to Adjustment Disorder and 146 to Anxiety Disorder. As shown in the left part of Figure 3, of these 228 EHRs, found that 61% and 34.2% correspond to where patient is a woman and a man, respectively. Only 4.8% of the notes correspond to cases where the patient’s sex is not identified. Additionally, the figure presents the age distribution of patients across the clinical notes, categorized in 5-year intervals. This histogram reveals that majority of patients fall within the 30 to 50-year age range, with a notable peak around the age of 40. Specifically, the highest number clinical notes corresponds to patients aged between 35 and 45 years. The distribution also shows that there are fewer clinical notes for patients below 20 years of age and above 70 years, indicating majority of the patient population receiving treatment for Disorder and Anxiety Disorder tends to be middle-aged. This age trend is consistent with research that shows a high prevalence these disorders among adults in their working years, likely due to life stressors and social factors often faced during this period (Lotzin al., 2021). To complement this general overview, Table 1 presents a detailed demographic breakdown by diag- nosis, including gender distribution and descriptive age statistics. In both diagnostic categories, female patients represent the majority: 60.9% in Disorder and 61.0% in Anxiety Disorder. Male representation is slightly higher in the Anxiety group (36.6%) compared Adjustment Disorder (32.9%), while the proportion of patients with unknown gender is relatively low in both groups. Regarding age, the average for Adjustment Disorder is 44.4 years (SD = 18.3), and for Anxiety Disorder it is 42.7 years, with a median of 42 years in both cases. These findings confirm that dataset is predominantly composed of middle-aged individuals, consistent across diagnostic categories, and reinforce the relevance of tailoring classification approaches to this demographic profile. The age distribution provides valuable demographic insights and helps to contextualize the clinical data being analyzed, especially in terms of tailoring interventions for specific age groups. The relatively lower of patients in the younger and older age ranges also raises important questions about the underrepresentation of these populations, possibly indicating a need for further exploration of psychiatric care in these demographics. 2.2 Machine Learning Learning models implemented An intriguing research avenue was explored, focusing on the evaluation of ML and DL models to identify the most accurate approach for addressing the problem. Both linear and non-linear approaches were selected to determine which best suited textual data, given its high dimensionality and potential semantic --- Page 8 --- 8/20 w|| i noise. Below, we describe the theoretical foundation and mathematical formulation each model, along with the motivation for its selection. • Random Forest: A versatile and widely used machine learning model that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes or the mean prediction of the individual trees. One key virtue of Random Forest in the context of clinical note classification, is its ability to handle high-dimensional and noisy data effectively, which is common in clinical settings (Al-Showarah al., 2023). This robustness ensures reliable classification even when dealing with complex medical information as could be the Psychiatry EHRs, improving the model’s accuracy and generalization on diverse clinical notes (Go´ngora Alonso al., 2022). Mathematically, Random Forest combines decision trees hi(x), where hi(x) represents the output of each individual tree i, and N is the total number of trees in the forest and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting for classification: yˆ = mode{h1(x), h2(x), . . . , hN(x)} (1) • Support Vector Classifier (SVC): a supervised learning model based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. In this task, SVC tries to maximize the margin between the data points of different classes, which helps in achieving better generalization. SVC can capture complex relationships clinical notes, as the nuanced patterns in clinical language (Elshewey et al., 2023; Lyu al., 2023). It is also robust to overfitting. The mathematical equation of the decision boundary is: f (x) = wT x + b (2) where w is the weight vector, x represents the input, and b is the bias term. The optimization process maximizes the margin || 2 subject to the following constraint where yi represents the class label: yi(wT xi + b) ≥ 1, ∀i (3) • Decision Trees: A type of supervised learning algorithm that makes classifications based on a series of decision rules derived from the input features. The model works by recursively splitting data into subsets based on feature values, creating branches that represent decision points. Each branch ultimately leads to a leaf node, which represents the predicted class or outcome. This model can help in classifying clinical notes because they are interpretable and can handle both numerical and categorical data. This interpretability is valuable in clinical settings, where understanding the reasoning behind a classification is important for trust and compliance (Valle´e al., 2023). Mathematically, node splitting is based on information gain or Gini index, defined below, where pi is proportion of instances of class i in dataset D. C Gini(D) = 1 − ∑ p2 (4) i=1 • XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting): is a powerful machine algorithm that based on gradient boosting techniques. works by creating an ensemble of decision trees, where each new tree corrects the errors made by the previous trees. The trees are added sequentially, with each one being optimized to reduce the total error. XGBoost uses gradient descent to minimize a loss function, which allows it to handle complex data patterns effectively (Mir and Sunanda, 2023). It can handle large datasets with high-dimensional features, as the variety of terms and medical concepts found in clinical text. It also supports regularization, which helps prevent --- Page 9 --- 9/20 overfitting—a common issue working with detailed clinical data. Additionally, XGBoost can efficiently process missing data and is relatively fast, making it well-suited for real-time or large-scale applications clinical settings (Ulhaq al., 2023). Each tree in XGBoost is built by minimizing the following regularized loss function, where l(yi, yˆi) represents the error function, and Ω( fk) penalizes model complexity to prevent overfitting: n L(θ ) = ∑ l(yi, yˆi) + ∑Ω( fk) (5) i=1 k • SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019): An adapted version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representa- tions from Transformers) that is specifically trained on scientific literature, including biomedical and computer science articles, which makes well-suited for handling the specialized language in medical contexts. Its transformer-based architecture it to understand words in their full context, making it effective for processing clinical notes. When fine-tuned for diagnostic classifica- tion, SciBERT can accurately identify in clinical text, recognizing terminology related to various medical conditions (Tang 2023). This makes it particularly valuable for automatically categorizing notes into diagnostic labels, improving the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis classification tasks in healthcare settings. The transformation function of each layer in BERT-based models is given by the following formula where Q, K,V are the query, key, and value matrices, respectively, and dk is the key dimension: QKT zi = softmax √dk V (6) • DistilBERT (Sanh al., 2019): is a distilled, or compressed, of BERT that retains much of BERT’s effectiveness while being smaller, faster, and more efficient. It achieves this through a process called ’knowledge distillation’, where a smaller model (DistilBERT) is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger model (BERT). DistilBERT has about 40% fewer parameters and is around 60% faster than BERT, but it retains around 97% of BERT’s language understanding capabilities. DistilBERT is useful for notes because it provides a good balance between performance and computational efficiency (Abdelhalim 2023). In clinical environments, where there may be constraints on processing power or the need for quick responses, DistilBERT can handle complex language and terminology effectively without requiring the resources that full-sized BERT models do. makes it suitable large-scale processing of clinical text, where quick and accurate classifications are necessary (Oh al., 2023; Le al., 2023). The selection of models in this study was driven by the need to evaluate both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for classifying psychiatric clinical notes. Random Forest and XGBoost were chosen for their strong generalization capabilities, while SVC was included to assess the effectiveness of a linear decision boundary. Decision Tree was selected for its interpretability, which critical in clinical decision-making. In deep learning, SciBERT was used due to its training on biomedical texts, well-suited for clinical language, while DistilBERT was included as a computationally efficient alternative. This diverse set of models ensures a comprehensive evaluation of classification techniques and performance. 2.3 Hardware and software Specifications For the execution of all experiments, Jupyter Notebooks were used. These notebooks were run using Python 3.9 and executed with the following hardware specifications: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz, 32.0GB RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card. The code used to perform the experiments described this study is publicly available at the following repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14872650. --- Page 10 --- 10/20 3 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 3.1 Data Preprocessing Preprocessing clinical notes written in Spanish is a crucial step in preparing data for classification tasks using NLP techniques. Since clinical notes contain unstructured medical information, multiple cleaning and transformation techniques must be to enhance data quality and performance of machine learning models. The following preprocessing steps were performed in detail: 1. Detection and handling of outliers: During exploratory analysis, it was detected that notes with fewer than 600 characters rarely contained relevant or substantial information. In many cases, they were administrative records without significant clinical data, and most of them lacked an actual diagnosis. avoid including non-representative records, a minimum threshold of 600 characters was established in consultation with psychiatrists. By applying this criterion, only notes with sufficient clinical content were processed, ensuring more effective classification. 2. Handling missing values: Missing values in patient age and gender were addressed by extracting information from context using regular expressions. This process was carefully designed improve the statistical reliability dataset and ensure a more accurate representation the patient population. 3. Lowercasing: All text was converted to lowercase to reduce unnecessary variability and prevent the model from interpreting words with different casing as distinct entities. In medical language, some words may be capitalized due to writing conventions, but they are semantically equivalent to their lowercase counterparts. This normalization ensured a more homogeneous analysis and reduced number of unique tokens in the model’s vocabulary Chai (2022). 4. Removal of special characters: Accents were removed to ensure that a single word is not represented in multiple ways in the model and preserving only spaces and Spanish language characters. RAJESH and HIWARKAR (2023). 5. Stopword removal: Frequent words in Spanish that do not contribute meaningful information for classification, such as ”el”, ”de”, ”que”, ”en”, ”un” and ”una” were removed using a Spanish stop-word list adapted to the clinical context. Words like ”patient,” ”symptom,” or ”treatment” were retained, as they are crucial in medical text analysis Sarica and Luo (2021). 6. Lemmatization: Lemmatization was applied using the spaCy library to reduce words to their canonical form, decreasing vocabulary dimensionality without losing meaning and maintaining the semantic integrity clinical notes, which is crucial for understanding the context medical text Babanejad et al. (2024). 7. Removal of extra whitespaces: Removing redundant whitespaces ensures text cleanliness and prevents models from misinterpreting the data as separate entities, improving tokenization accuracy Chai (2022). This preprocessing pipeline optimized the representation clinical notes, reducing data noise and the model’s ability to capture key semantic patterns in medical texts. 3.2 Experimental Design To evaluate performance of various classification models in distinguishing between diagnoses of and Anxiety Disorder, three different approaches were adopted handling the training data. These approaches were: (1) without applying any oversampling techniques, (2) using Oversampling, and (3) employing the Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Oversampling techniques, such Oversampling and SMOTE, are commonly used in machine learning dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class is significantly underrepresented compared to the other. this study, these techniques were explored to see how they improve ability to correctly classify both disorders, particularly the less common diagnosis, without overfitting to the majority class. Additionally, ensure that the distribution of classes (Adjustment and Anxiety Disorder) remained consistent in both the training and test sets, stratification was applied. Stratification is a method --- Page 11 --- 11/20 that ensures the class proportions are maintained when splitting the dataset, which is particularly important in imbalanced datasets like this one. Without stratification, there is a risk that of the sets (training or test) could have a disproportionate number of cases from one class, leading to unreliable performance metrics. By using stratified sampling, the training (70%) and testing (30%) sets maintain the same distribution Anxiety Disorder cases, providing a fair and consistent evaluation during model training and testing. This step was essential for obtaining reliable performance measurements, as class imbalance can otherwise skew model performance toward the majority class, resulting in misleadingly high accuracy that does not reflect true generalization. Stratification helps prevent this by ensuring that both the minority and majority classes are well-represented in each dataset split, allowing model to learn from a balanced representation of both diagnoses. The classification models selected for this task for their varied approaches and capabilities in handling types of data. These models included learning models as Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree, well as more advanced models like XGBoost. In addition, two pre-trained transformer-based models, DistilBERT and SciBERT, were employed to leverage their capacity for understanding complex text patterns, particularly of clinical notes. Each model was evaluated based on two primary metrics: Accuracy and F1-Score. Accuracy provides a general measure of how often the model makes correct predictions and F1-Score gives a more balanced view of model performance in this context. 3.3 Results This subsection describes the results of experiments conducted on all models, both with and without use of oversampling techniques. Table 2 presents the performance metrics for each model, highlighting their classification capabilities. The evaluation focuses on key metrics, particularly accuracy and F1-Score, effectiveness of the models under these conditions. 3.3.1 Models without Oversampling Techniques classification models were first evaluated any oversampling techniques. The models demonstrated good performance, though there was significant variability among them. The XGBoost model achieved the best results, with an accuracy of 96% and an F1-Score of 0.97, indicating excellent classification ability. Decision Tree model followed, accuracy of 93% F1-Score of 0.94. These results suggest that tree-based models, particularly XGBoost, are highly effective for the task of clinical notes in this dataset. The Random Forest model also showed satisfactory performance accuracy of 81% F1-Score of 0.87. However, the SVC model performed worse, accuracy of 70% F1-Score of 0.81, indicating that it struggled to effectively capture the relationships between features and classes in data. The pre-trained transformer (DistilBERT and SciBERT) performed similarly, both achieving accuracy of 91% F1-Score of 0.93. This suggests that these language models, specialized in scientific and clinical text, are particularly useful for this task, outperforming simpler models like SVC and Random Forest. The results obtained without the application of oversampling techniques highlight the strong performance of the XGBoost and Decision Tree models, as effectiveness of pre-trained transformer models. SVC model showed limitations in its classification capability this context.

Models Performance Across Experiments (Exp = Experiment, XGB = XGBoost, WO = Without Oversampling, RO = Random Oversampling, SMOTE) --- Page 12 --- 12/20 3.3.2 Models with Random Oversampling This subsection the models after applying random oversampling to balance dataset. The introduction of random oversampling had mixed effects model performance. XGBoost model continued to achieve the highest performance, maintaining of 0.97, consistent with the results without oversampling. suggests that the XGBoost model is robust to class imbalance, and the oversampling did not significantly alter ability to classify clinical notes. Tree model saw a slight decrease in performance to without oversampling. Its accuracy dropped from 93% to 87%, and the F1-Score decreased to 0.90. This may suggest that random oversampling introduced some noise, reducing to generalize well to the test data. Forest model showed no change in performance, with accuracy and F1-Score remaining at 81% and 0.87, respectively. Similarly, the SVC model’s performance remained largely unchanged, F1-Score of 0.81. These indicate random did not provide a substantial improvement for these in this classification task. Notably, the DistilBERT model experienced a significant drop in performance when random over- sampling was applied. Its accuracy fell to 55%, and its F1-Score dropped to 0.55, suggesting that this transformer-based model was negatively affected by the oversampling technique. other hand, SciBERT maintained its strong performance, F1-Score of 0.93, that it was more resilient to the oversampling method. Random oversampling had varying model performance. While it did not lead to improvements in most models, XGBoost maintained its high level of accuracy, and SciBERT remained effective. However, the in performance for DistilBERT suggests that careful consideration is needed when applying oversampling techniques, especially with transformer-based models. 3.3.3 Models with SMOTE This subsection outlines after applying SMOTE to address class imbalance. Compared to random oversampling, SMOTE generally had a more positive model performance. Once again, highest of 0.97, demon- strating consistency across different data balancing techniques. This reinforces XGBoost’s robustness and adaptability to imbalanced datasets, as SMOTE alter its performance. Tree model showed a slight improvement with SMOTE compared random oversampling, reaching accuracy of 88% F1-Score of 0.90. This marginal increase indicates that SMOTE helped the model better generalize, although the performance is still lower than without any oversampling technique. model also saw an improvement, with accuracy rising from 81% to 87% the F1-Score improving 0.90. suggests that SMOTE was more effective than random oversampling in classify the minority class majority class. SVC, however, did not show any noticeable improvement, with its accuracy remaining at of 0.81, similar to its performance oversampling technique. This indicates that SVC’s to capture the dataset was not enhanced by SMOTE. For the transformer-based models, both and SciBERT maintained strong and consistent performance, each of 0.93. Unlike with random oversam- pling, DistilBERT’s performance remained stable with SMOTE, that the synthetic examples generated by this method may have been better aligned with the underlying data distribution, thereby avoiding the performance degradation observed earlier. SMOTE had a generally on model performance, especially for Forest Decision Tree, improving to handle imbalanced data. maintained its exceptional performance, and the transformer models continued to show resilience, with DistilBERT recovering from its previous in performance with random oversampling. 3.4 Hyperparameter Tuning presents results hyperparameter tuning performed all models, and without oversampling techniques, to optimize their performance. The complete hyperparameter search space for each model is summarized in Table 3. This information provides a clearer view of the experimental setup and supports the reproducibility of the results. A 3-fold cross-validation was applied during hyperparameter search to ensure robust evaluation of each configuration. The results each model after tuning are shown in Table 4. The goal hyperparameter tuning was the classification metrics, primarily focusing on accuracy and F1-Score. --- Page 13 --- 13/20 Model Hyperparameters Random Forest n estimators: [30, 97, 165, 232, 300]; max features: [’sqrt’, ’log2’]; max depth: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, None]; min samples split: [2, 5, 10]; min samples leaf: [1, 2, 4]; bootstrap: [True, False] SVM C: [0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 50, 100, 1000]; gamma: [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001]; kernel: [’rbf’, ’linear’, ’sigmoid’, ’poly’] Decision Tree criterion: [’gini’, ’entropy’, ’log loss’]; splitter: [’best’, ’random’]; max depth: 1–29; samples split: 1–19; samples leaf: 1–19; features: [’sqrt’, ’log2’, None]; min weight fraction leaf: [0.0]; random state: [100] XGBoost objective: [’binary:logistic’, ’binary:logitraw’, ’binary:hinge’]; learning rate: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5]; n estimators: [100, 200, 300, 400]; min child weight: [1, 5, 10]; gamma: [1, 2, 5]; subsample: [0.6, 0.8, 1.0]; colsample bytree: 0.8, 1.0]; max depth: [2, 3, 4, 5] DistilBERT learning rate: [1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5]; batch size: [8, 16, 32]; epochs: [3, 5, 10] SciBERT size: [8, 16]; 5, 10] Table 3. Hyperparameter for each model. 3.4.1 Hyperparameter Tuning without Oversampling After tuning the hyperparameters, most models showed improved performance when no oversampling techniques were applied. Notably, the Tree a significant boost, rising 93% to 96% the F1-Score reaching 0.97. suggests that fine-tuning the model parameters helped improve its capacity to better distinguish between the classes. The SVC model also demonstrated substantial improvements, its accuracy increasing from 70% to 88% its F1-Score reaching 0.91. These improvements reflect the positive impact of hyperparameter optimization on ability to better handle the in Forest model improved slightly, with accuracy reaching 86% of 0.90. Meanwhile, XGBoost saw a small decline in accuracy (from 96% to 93%) after hyperparameter tuning, though it still maintained exceptional performance. The in performance might indicate that the default parameters were already close to optimal for this model. For the transformer and SciBERT improved their accuracy 96% and their F1-Scores to 0.97. These gains suggest that tuning transformer- specific parameters, such as learning rate and number of epochs, helped these models better capture the nuances the clinical text, further boosting their effectiveness. 3.4.2 Hyperparameter Tuning Random Oversampling In the models trained with random oversampling, hyperparameter tuning led to notable improvements for the SVC model, which saw its accuracy rise its F1-Score improve to 0.91, making it much more competitive compared to its previous Tree model also benefited from --- Page 14 --- 14/20 WO Accuracy 0.86 0.88 0.96 0.93 0.96 0.96 F1-Score 0.90 0.91 0.97 0.94 0.97 0.97 RO Accuracy 0.84 0.88 0.96 0.96 0.94 0.94 F1-Score 0.89 0.91 0.97 0.97 0.95 0.95 SMOTE Accuracy 0.83 0.88 0.91 0.96 0.96 F1-Score 0.87 0.91 0.97 0.97 0.97 Table 4.

The transformer and SciBERT, both showed improvements accuracy and F1-Scores rising to 94% and 0.95, respectively, that the combination random oversampling and tuning positively impacted clinical notes accurately. 3.4.3 Tuning with SMOTE When SMOTE was used in conjunction with hyperparameter tuning, the results were similarly positive. SVC model achieved F1-Score of 0.91, consistent with its performance under other techniques. experienced a performance increase, accuracy rising to of 0.94. Random Forest, however, with accuracy dropping to 83% F1-Score of 0.87, suggesting that tuning in combination with synthetic data did not favor this model. XGBoost to achieve excellent results, F1-Score of 0.97. and SciBERT, also improved tuning, with 96% and a of 0.97. tuning was generally effective in enhancing model performance across various Tree and SVC models saw the most significant improvements, while XGBoost remained highly consistent. Transformer models also benefited notably from the optimization process. 3.5 Computational Performance The computational time required for hyperparameter tuning varied significantly the models, as in Table 5. Traditional Forest, SVM, Tree, and XGB exhibited relatively low computational costs, with average times of 0.912 seconds (Random Forest), 0.091 seconds (SVM), 0.003 seconds (Decision Tree), and 0.103 seconds (XGB) per configuration. In contrast, transformer-based such as and SciBERT required substantially higher computational resources, with average tuning times of 75.70 seconds and 65.52 seconds per configuration, respectively. These results highlight a clear computational trade-off: while traditional models are significantly more efficient in hyperparameter tuning, transformer-based models demand considerably more processing time. However, prior studies suggest that this increased computational cost often translates into superior performance terms of and generalization Ben´ıtez-Andrades et al. (2022); Mele´ndez al. (2024). 4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION This research has contributed to field of clinical text classification by examining effectiveness of different distinguishing between Anxiety Disorder based on clinical notes. Several important findings emerged from this study, highlighting the strengths and limitations the models employed, as the impact of applying oversampling techniques address class imbalance the dataset. --- Page 15 --- 15/20 Model Combinations Time (s) Time/Combination Random Forest 1080 985.267 0.912 SVM 192 17.482 0.091 Decision Tree [PHONE].747 0.003 XGB [PHONE].597 0.103 DistilBERT 27 2043.965 75.70 SciBERT 18 1179.506 65.52 Table 5. Computational of each model used. 4.1 Model Performance Among the models tested, XGBoost emerged as the best-performing algorithm, consistently demonstrating high and F1-Score across all experimental setups. Specifically, XGBoost achieved an F1- Score of 0.97 of oversampling techniques, proving its robustness in handling the complexities clinical text classification. The model maintained strong performance even hyperparameter tuning, confirming ability effectively capture class distinctions while maintaining generalization, despite the dataset. In contrast, Vector Classifier (SVC) model exhibited the weakest performance, particularly without oversampling, where it struggled of 0.81. This is to the sensitivity of SVC datasets, where minority class may be overshadowed by majority class. Although hyperparameter tuning and oversampling techniques Oversampling and SMOTE improved SVC’s performance (raising F1-Score to 0.91 in some cases), its results remained below those of models like XGBoost, SciBERT, and DistilBERT. These findings indicate that while SVC can be a reliable option in certain domains, it may not be well-suited for imbalanced text classification tasks without significant adjustments. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the comparative of the deep learning models, respectively. 4.2 The Impact of Oversampling Techniques A key aspect this research was evaluation of two oversampling techniques: Oversampling and SMOTE. The that oversampling had a varying model performance, particularly for models sensitive to class imbalance. For models like Forest and XGBoost, Random Oversampling did not result in significant performance gains, and some cases, even led to a slight drop in performance. For instance, DistilBERT experienced a considerable decline when random oversampling was applied, with the F1-Score dropping to 0.55. suggests that Random Oversampling may introduce noise, particularly in more complex models, and thus does not consistently benefit all models. SMOTE, on other hand, proved be a more effective technique for improving across various models. In particular, SMOTE enhanced performance of models like Tree and Random Forest, which achieved F1-Scores of 0.90 and 0.90, respectively, when applied. Furthermore, such as XGBoost and transformer-based models like SciBERT maintained their strong performance with SMOTE, both achieving F1-Scores 0.97. indicate SMOTE these models create more balanced decision boundaries without duplicating existing data points, leading to more robust classification outcomes. It was found that, while oversampling techniques generally improved performance, more effective across a range of models, particularly for complex architectures like XGBoost and transformer- based models. 4.3 Comparison Between Transformer Models and Traditional Machine Learning The and SciBERT, demonstrated strong results throughout the experiments, confirming their potential for natural language processing tasks in the healthcare domain. In comparison to as Forest and SVC, the transformers- based models were better at capturing the nuances of clinical language, particularly were applied. SciBERT, pretrained on scientific texts, was particularly noteworthy, achieving F1-Score 0.97 with SMOTE, highlighting its strength in parsing and classifying the specialized terminology found in --- Page 16 --- 16/20 Figure 4. Visual comparison accuracy and F1-score across learning models using different configurations (WO Random Oversampling, H = Hyperparameters) clinical notes. DistilBERT performed well across all setups, reinforcing the potential of transformer-based models in healthcare text classification tasks. Notably, these transformer models remained highly effective, even when class imbalance was not addressed through oversampling techniques. 4.4 Impact of Hyperparameter Tuning tuning was a critical component in this study, as it helped performance of all models. The results clearly show that hyperparameter tuning had a significant impact on improving classification metrics, for models that initially struggled with imbalanced data or suboptimal settings. The most notable improvement was observed in Decision Tree model, where hyperparameter tuning increased its accuracy 96% its F1-Score to 0.97 no oversampling was applied. This demonstrates that tuning allowed Tree model to make better splits and generalize more effectively on the data, leading to performance that matched the top-performing such as XGBoost. SVC model benefited substantially from hyperparameter tuning. Initially, SVC with imbalanced data, but after tuning, its accuracy increased its F1-Score improved to These improvements indicate that carefully optimizing parameters like the kernel and gamma allowed SVC between the diagnostic categories. SciBERT, also saw improvements with hyperparameter tuning. Both and SciBERT of 0.97 after tuning. suggest that while the transformers performed well without significant tuning, the --- Page 17 --- 17/20 Figure 5. F1-score across = Hyperparameters) fine-tuning of parameters like number of epochs still provided marginal performance boosts. For the XGBoost model, however, a slight reduction in accuracy, dropping from 96% to 93%, although its F1-Score remained high at 0.94. suggests that XGBoost may have already been operating near its optimal settings. Hyperparameter tuning be a valuable step in improving performance. While and SVC the most pronounced benefits, even advanced such as transformers and XGBoost showed gains in certain metrics, reaffirming hyperparameter optimization in machine deep learning workflows. 4.5 Limitations and Future Directions Despite models tested, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the dataset, although preprocessed, might still contain noise inherent to such as inconsistent terminology or incomplete information, which could affect model performance. Future studies could focus on refining the preprocessing pipeline to handle these nuances more effectively, potentially leading to further improvements in classification accuracy. Additionally, while this study demonstrated value oversampling techniques, there are alternative methods for addressing class imbalance that were not explored, such as cost-sensitive learning or under- sampling methods, which could be examined in future research. These techniques might offer more efficient solutions, especially in scenarios where oversampling introduces overfitting or data redundancy. Future directions could also consider exploring Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) as a generative approach for oversampling. Another avenue for future research involves evaluating additional classification models beyond those tested in this study. Exploring more advanced deep learning architectures or novel transformer-based models could further enhance classification performance, particularly in complex diagnostic scenarios. Moreover, expanding the dataset to include notes from patients presenting similar symptomatology but ultimately receiving different diagnoses would provide a more challenging and realistic classification setting. This would help assess the models’ to capture subtle clinical distinctions, critical in psychiatric evaluation. Finally, although transformer models performed well, their computational cost and need for large datasets for fine-tuning present practical challenges. Future work could explore use of more efficient transformer architectures or hybrid models that combine the strengths of transformers and machine learning approaches. --- Page 18 --- 18/20 REFERENCES Abdelhalim, N., Abdelhalim, I., and Batista-Navarro, R.

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by pro- viding models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically re- trieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in pre- dicting court decisions and generating legal ex- planations using a domain-specific pipeline tai- lored to the Indian legal system. We assess per- formance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic met- rics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G- Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge signifi- cantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality. 1 Introduction The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in le- gal judgment prediction (LJP) has the potential to transform legal systems by improving efficiency, transparency, and access to justice. This is partic- ularly crucial for India, where millions of cases remain pending in courts, and decision-making is inherently dependent on factual narratives, statu- tory interpretation, and judicial precedent. India follows a common law system, where prior deci- sions (precedents) and statutory provisions play a central role in influencing legal outcomes. How- ever, most existing AI-based LJP systems do not ∗These authors contributed equally to this work †Corresponding author adequately replicate this fundamental feature of judicial reasoning. Previous studies such as Malik et al. (2021); Nigam et al. (2024b, 2025a) have focused on pre- dicting legal outcomes using the current case docu- ment, including sections like facts, arguments, is- sues, reasoning, and decision. More recent efforts have narrowed the scope to factual inputs alone (Nigam et al., 2024a, 2025b), yet these systems still operate in a vacuum, without considering how courts naturally rely on applicable laws and prior rulings. In reality, judges rarely decide in isolation; instead, they actively refer to relevant precedent and statutory law. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that more closely mirrors actual court- room conditions by explicitly incorporating exter- nal legal knowledge during inference. Moreover, in critical domains like finance, medicine, and law, decisions must be grounded in verifiable information. Experts in these domains cannot rely on opaque, black-box inferences, and they require systems that ensure factual consistency. Hallucinations, common in large generative mod- els, can have severe consequences in legal decision- making. By retrieving and conditioning model re- sponses on grounded sources such as laws and precedent cases, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a principled approach to mitigate hallucination and promote trustworthy out- puts. Furthermore, RAG frameworks like ours can be flexibly integrated into existing legal systems without requiring the retraining of core models or the sharing of private or sensitive case data. This enhances user trust while allowing the legal com- munity to benefit from AI without sacrificing trans- parency or data confidentiality. We introduce NyayaRAG, a (RAG) framework for realistic legal judgment prediction and explanation the Indian common law system. The term “NyayaRAG” is derived from two components: “Nyaya” mean- arXiv:2508.00709v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- ing “justice” and “RAG” referring to “Retrieval- Augmented Generation”. Together, the name re- flects our vision to build a justice-aware genera- tion system that emulates the reasoning process followed by Indian courts, using facts, statutes, and precedents. Unlike prior models that operate purely on in- ternal case content, NyayaRAG simulates real-world judicial decision-making by providing the model with: (i) the summarized factual background of the current case, (ii) relevant statutory provisions, (iii) top-k semantically retrieved previous similar judg- ments. This structure emulates how judges deliber- ate on new cases, consulting both textual statutes and prior judicial opinions. Through this design, we evaluate how Retrieval-Augmented Generation can help reduce hallucinations, promote faithful- ness, and yield legally coherent predictions and explanations. Our contributions are as follows: 1. A Realistic RAG Framework for Indian Courts: We present NyayaRAG, a novel framework that emulates common law decision-making by incorporating not only facts but also retrieved legal statutes and precedents. 2. Retrieval-Augmented Pipelines with Structured Inputs: We construct modular pipelines repre- senting different combinations of factual, statu- tory, and precedent-based inputs to understand their individual and combined contributions to model performance. 3. Simulating Common Law Reasoning with LLMs: We show that LLMs guided by RAG and factual grounding can produce legally faithful explana- tions aligned with how real-world decisions are made under common law reasoning. Our work moves beyond fact-only or self- contained models by replicating a more faithful le- gal reasoning pipeline aligned with Indian jurispru- dence. We hope that NyayaRAG opens new direc- tions for building interpretable, retrieval-aware AI systems in legal settings, particularly in resource- constrained yet precedent-driven judicial systems like India’s. For the sake of reproducibility, we have made our dataset, code, and RAG-based pipeline implementation via a GitHub repository1. 2 Related Work Recent advancements in natural language process- ing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have 1https://github.com/ShubhamKumarNigam/RAGLegal significantly improved the performance of ques- tion answering (QA) and legal decision support systems. Transformer-based architectures such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2019), and their instruction-tuned successors have led to robust capabilities in knowledge-intensive and multi-hop reasoning tasks. The integration of external information via Generation (RAG) as a particularly ef- fective approach for enhancing generation fidelity and reducing hallucinations (Han et al., 2024; Hei et al., 2024). Within the legal domain, Legal Judgment Pre- diction (LJP) has seen significant progress, with models trained to infer outcomes based on factual and procedural components of court cases (Strick- son and De La Iglesia, 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2023). In Indian legal context, the ILDC corpus (Malik et al., 2021) and its extended vari- ants et al., 2024b; Nigam and Deroy, 2023) have enabled the development of supervised and instruction-tuned models for both judgment predic- tion and explanation. The emergence of domain- specific datasets and architectures has allowed LJP systems to move from simple binary classification to more complex reasoning tasks aligned with real judicial behavior (Vats al., 2023). Parallel to these developments, there has been a sharp rise in interest in RAG techniques for legal NLP. Several benchmark and system-level contribu- tions have explored how retrieval-enhanced gener- ation can be leveraged to assist legal professionals, improve legal QA systems, and support document analysis. Notably, LegalBench-RAG (Pipitone and Alami, 2024) introduced a benchmark suite for eval- uating RAG in the legal domain. Survey papers like (Hindi et al., 2025) provide comprehensive overviews of techniques aimed at improving RAG performance, factual grounding, and interpretabil- ity in legal settings. Several system-level contributions have demon- strated the power of RAG in specialized applica- tions. Graph-RAG for Legal Norms (de Martim, 2025) and Bridging Legal Knowledge and AI (Bar- ron al., 2025) proposed methods to integrate legal knowledge such as statutes and normative hierarchies into the retrieval pipeline. Similarly, CBR-RAG (Wiratunga et al., 2024) ap- plied case-based reasoning to leverage historical decisions, showing strong gains in legal question answering. HyPA-RAG (Kalra al., 2024) ex- plored hybrid parameter-adaptive retrieval to dy- --- Page 3 --- Figure 1: Illustration of our Judgment Prediction framework using RAG. The input legal judgment is first summarized; a RAG agent retrieves top-3 relevant documents from a vector database; and an instruction-tuned LLM (e.g., LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct) generates the final prediction and explanation. namically adjust context based on query specificity. Further domain-specific applications include AI-powered legal assistants like Legal Query RAG (Wahidur al., 2025) and RAG-based so- lutions for dispute resolution in housing law (Rafat, 2024). Optimizing Legal Information Access (Am- ato al., 2024) showcased federated RAG architec- tures for secure document retrieval, and Augment- ing Prediction with Contrastive Case Relations (Liu et al., 2022) illustrated the benefits of encoding contrastive precedents for pre- dictive reasoning. 3 Task Description India’s judicial system operates within the com- mon law framework, where judges deliberate cases based on three fundamental pillars: (i) the fac- tual context of the case, (ii) applicable statutory provisions, and (iii) relevant judicial precedents. Our task is designed to simulate such realistic legal decision-making by leveraging Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling models to access external during inference. Figure 1 illustrates diction (LJP) pipeline enhanced with RAG. The pipeline begins with a full legal judgment doc- ument, which undergoes summarization to re- duce its length and retain essential factual mean- ing. This is necessary because legal judgments tend to be long, and appending retrieved knowl- edge further increases the input size. Given limited model capacity and computational re- sources, we employ a summarization step (using Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) to create a con- densed representation of both the input case and the retrieved legal context. Prediction Task: Based on the summarized fac- tual description D the retrieved top-k (e.g., k = 3) similar legal documents (statutes or prece- dents), the model predicts the likely court judgment. The prediction label y ∈{0, 1} indicates whether the appeal is fully rejected (0) or fully/partially ac- cepted (1). This binary framing captures the most common forms of judicial decisions in Indian ap- pellate courts. Explanation Task: Alongside the decision, the model is also required to generate an explanation that justifies its output. This explanation should log- ically incorporate the facts, cited statutes, and rele- vant precedents retrieved during the RAG process. This step how judges provide reasoned opinions in written judgments. By structuring the LJP task in this way, sum- marizing long documents and integrating retrieval- based augmentation, we study effectiveness of RAG agents in producing judgments that are both faithful to legal reasoning and grounded in prece- dent and statute. The overall framework allows us to approximate a real-world decision-making environment within Indian courtrooms. 4 Dataset Our dataset to simulate realistic court decision-making legal context, incor- porating statutes, and precedent, essential elements under the common law framework.

The web- site provides structural tags for various judgment components (e.g., facts, issues, arguments), which allowed for clean and structured scraping. These documents serve as the foundation for our summa- rization, retrieval, and reasoning experiments. 4.2 Dataset Composition The corpus supports multiple downstream pipelines, each focusing on specific judgment elements or legal context. Table 1 presents key statistics across different configurations, and an example breakdown is shown in the Appendix Table 7. 4.2.1 Case Text Each judgment includes complete narrative con- tent such as factual background, party argu- ments, legal issues, reasoning, and verdict. Due to length constraints exceeding model context windows, we summarized these documents us- ing Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2024), which supports up to 32k tokens. The summarization preserved critical legal elements through carefully designed prompts (see Table 2). 4.2.2 Precedents From each judgment, cited precedents were ex- tracted using metadata tags provided by Indi- anKanoon. These citations represent explicit reasoning and are retained for use during inference to replicate how courts consider prior judgments. 4.2.3 Statutes Statutory references were also programmatically extracted, including citations to laws like the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. Where 2https://indiankanoon.org/ statute sections exceeded length limits, they were summarized using the same LLM pipeline. Only statutes directly cited in the respective cases were retained, ensuring relevance. 4.2.4 Previous Similar Cases To simulate implicit precedent-based reasoning, we employed semantic similarity retrieval to identify relevant previous cases beyond explicit citations: • Corpus Vectorization: All 56,387 documents were embedded into dense vector representations using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence trans- former. • Target Encoding: The 5,000 selected training samples were vectorized similarly. • Top-k Retrieval: Using ChromaDB, we retrieved the top-3 most semantically similar cases for each document based on cosine similarity. • Augmentation: Retrieved cases were appended to the factual input to form the “casetext + previous similar cases” input during model inference. This retrieval step enriches context with prece- dents that are semantically close, even if not cited, enhancing the legal realism of our setup. 4.2.5 Facts We separately extracted the factual portions of all 56,387 judgments. These include background infor- mation, chronological events, and party narratives, excluding legal reasoning. These fact-only subsets were used simulate courtroom scenarios where judges primarily rely on facts, relevant law, and precedent for decision-making. Overall, our dataset is uniquely structured to test legal decision-making under realistic constraints, aligning with Indian legal system’s reliance factual narratives, statutory frameworks, prior rulings. 5 Methodology To simulate realistic prediction and eval- uate the role RAG in enhancing legal decision- making, we design a modular experimental setup. This setup explores how different types of legal information, as factual summaries, statutes, and precedents, affect model performance on the dual tasks of and explanation. To en- sure reproducibility and transparency, we detail the full experimental setup, including model configu- rations, training routines, and task-specific hyper- parameters, in Appendix A. This includes separate --- Page 5 --- Summarization Prompt The text is regarding a court judgment for a specific case.

Each pipeline configu- ration represents a distinct input scenario reflecting different degrees of legal context and retrieval aug- mentation. These pipelines as follows: • CaseText Only: Includes only the summarized version of the full case judgment, which contains factual background, arguments, and reasoning. • CaseText + Statutes: Appends summarized statutory references in the judgment to the case text, simulating scenarios where relevant laws are explicitly considered. CaseText + Precedents: Incorporates prior cited judgments mentioned in the original case, repre- senting explicitly relied-upon precedents. CaseText + Previous Similar Cases: Adds top- 3 semantically similar past judgments (retrieved via ChromaDB using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 em- beddings), allowing the model to learn from precedents not explicitly cited. CaseText + Statutes + Precedents: A compre- hensive legal input pipeline combining the full judgment summary, statutes, and cited prior judg- ments. • Facts Only: A minimal pipeline containing only the factual summary, excluding all legal reason- ing and verdicts. This setup evaluates whether a model can infer judgments from facts alone. • Facts + Precedents: Combines fac- tual input with statutory and precedent context realistic courtroom conditions where judges on facts, applicable law, and relevant past cases. This modular design enables granular control over input features and facilitates direct compari- son of how each knowledge source contributes to and explanation generation. 5.2 Prompt Design To ensure consistency and interpretability across all pipelines, we used fixed instruction prompts with minor variations depending on the available contextual inputs (e.g., facts only vs. facts + law + precedent). These prompts guide the model in producing both binary predictions and natural lan- guage explanations. Prompts were structured to reflect real judicial inquiry formats, with the instruction-following capabilities of modern LLMs. Full prompt templates are listed in Ap- pendix Table 8, along with prediction examples. 5.3 Inference Setup We use the LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct (Dubey al., 2024) model for all experiments in a few-shot prompting setup. Each input sequence, composed according to one of the pipeline templates, is paired with a relevant prompt. The model is required to output: • A binary judgment prediction: 0 (appeal rejected) or 1 (appeal fully/partially accepted) • A justification: a coherent explanation based on legal statutes, and precedent model is explicitly instructed to reason with the provided information and emulate judicial writ- ing. Retrieved knowledge (via RAG) is included in-context to enhance legal reasoning while mini- mizing hallucinations. This experimental design us to evaluate effectiveness of legal retrieval and summariza- tion under realistic judicial decision-making con- straints common law setting. 6 Evaluation Metrics To effectiveness of our Retrieval- Augmented Judgment Prediction framework, we adopt a comprehensive set of metrics covering both classification and explanation qual- ity. The evaluation is conducted on two fronts: the judgment prediction task and the explanation gen- eration task. These metrics are selected to ensure a holistic assessment of model performance in the --- Page 6 --- Pipeline Name Partition Accuracy Precision Recall F1-score CaseText Only Single 62.27 33.50 30.88 29.45 Multi 53.10 25.26 23.95 20.81 + Statutes Single 67.07 45.29 44.55 44.32 Multi 60.36 64.22 64.04 60.35 CaseText + Precedents Single 61.73 41.92 41.35 40.81 Multi 57.53 61.34 61.19 57.53 Similar Cases Single 61.19 57.53 Multi 41.92 41.35 Statutes Precedents Single 64.71 43.50 42.98 42.78 Multi 65.86 63.94 63.99 63.96 CaseFacts Only Single 51.13 51.36 51.30 50.68 Multi 53.71 51.18 51.18 51.18 Precedents Single 50.58 33.57 33.56 33.24 Multi 52.57 52.01 52.01 52.01 Table 3: Performance of Various Pipelines on Binary and Multi-label Legal Judgment Prediction.

We report Macro Precision, Macro Recall, Macro F1, and Accuracy for judgment pre- diction, and we use both quantitative and qualita- tive methods evaluate the quality of explanations generated by the model. 1. Lexical-based Evaluation: We utilized stan- dard lexical similarity metrics, including Rouge- L (Lin, 2004), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005). These metrics measure the overlap and order of words between the generated explanations and the ref- erence texts, providing a quantitative assessment of the lexical accuracy of the model outputs. 2. Semantic Similarity-based Evaluation: To capture the semantic quality of the generated explanations, we employed BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), which measures the semantic simi- larity the generated text ref- erence explanations. Additionally, we used BLANC (Vasilyev al., 2020), a metric that estimates quality of generated text without a gold standard, evaluate the model’s ability to produce semantically meaningful and contextu- ally relevant explanations. 3. LLM-based Evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge): To complement traditional metrics, we incorpo- rate an automatic evaluation strategy that uses language models themselves as evaluators, commonly referred to as LLM-as-a-Judge. This evaluation is crucial for assessing structured ar- gumentation and legal correctness in a format aligned with expert judicial reasoning. We adopt G-Eval et al., 2023), a GPT-4-based eval- uation framework tailored for natural language generation tasks. G-Eval leverages chain-of- thought prompting and structured scoring to as- sess explanations along three key criteria: fac- tual accuracy, completeness & coverage, and clarity & coherence. Each generated legal ex- planation is scored on a scale from 1 to 10 based on how well it aligns with the expected content and a reference document. The exact prompt format used for evaluation shown in Appendix Table 9. For our experiments, we use the GPT- 4o-mini model to generate reliable scores with- out manual intervention. This setup provides an interpretable, unified judgment metric that captures legal soundness, completeness of rea- soning, and logical coherence, beyond what tra- ditional similarity-based metrics can offer. 4. Expert Evaluation: To validate the inter- pretability and legal soundness of the model- explanations, we conduct an expert evaluation involving legal professionals. They rate a representative subset the generated out- puts on a 1–10 Likert scale across three criteria: factual accuracy, legal relevance, and complete- ness of reasoning. A score of 1 denotes a poor or misleading explanation, while a 10 reflects high legal fidelity and argumentative soundness. This evaluation provides critical insights beyond automated metrics. 5. Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA): To ensure the reliability and consistency of expert judg- ments, we compute standard IAA statistics, in- cluding Fleiss’ Kappa, Cohen’s Kappa, Krippen- dorff’s Alpha, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and Pearson Correlation. These metrics quantify the degree of agreement across expert raters, reinforcing the credibility of the expert evaluation framework. Full details and scores are available in Appendix B. 7 Results and Analysis We conducted extensive evaluations across mul- tiple pipeline configurations to study impact of different legal information components on both explanation quality. Ta- bles 3 and 4 summarize the model’s performance across these configurations for binary and multi- label settings. 7.1 Judgment Prediction Performance As shown in Table 3, the pipeline combining Case- Text + Statutes achieved the highest accuracy in the single-label setting. This suggests that legal statutes provide substantial contextual cues for model to infer the likely decision.

Interestingly, the + Previous Sim- ilar Cases pipeline showed the highest precision, recall, and F1-score the single-label case, indicat- ing that semantically retrieved precedents, despite not being explicitly cited, help the model align with actual judicial outcomes.

This comprehensive context provides the model structured legal knowledge, im- proving generalization across different outcome labels. Conversely, the Facts Only pipeline per- formed worst overall, reaffirming that factual nar- ratives alone, without legal context, are insufficient for reliably predicting legal outcomes. The poor performance of the + Precedents pipeline the single-label setting suggests that factual sections might lack the interpretive cues that full case texts offer when combined with legal references. 7.2 Explanation Generation Quality Table 4 presents the results of explanation evalua- tion using a diverse set of metrics, including both automatic and semantic metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, BLANC) and a large language model-based evaluation (G-Eval). Across both single and multi-label setups, the + Statutes pipeline consistently outperformed all other configurations. In the single-label setting, it the highest scores across key dimen- sions, substantially outperforming the CaseText Only baseline. This result underscores the criti- cal role of statutory references in enhancing both the factual alignment and interpretability of model- generated legal explanations. Interestingly, while Cases pipeline yielded strong lexical overlap (e.g., top ROUGE-L in the unabridged version), it lagged behind the statute-enhanced pipeline in metrics that assess semantic and contextual align- ment, such as G-Eval and BLANC. This indicates that while similar cases might the model repli- cate surface-level language, they may not consis- tently offer legally grounded or complete reason- ing. Meanwhile, Statutes + Prece- dents pipeline also performed competitively, sug- gesting that combining structured legal references with precedent data can lead to balanced and high- quality explanations. In contrast, configurations that relied solely on factual narratives (CaseFacts Only and Statutes + Precedents) exhibited comparatively poor performance across all evaluation metrics. For example, Precedents pipeline recorded a G-Eval score as low setting. This reinforces the notion that factual descriptions, while essential, insufficient for constructing legally persuasive rationales. The absence of structured legal arguments, statutory alignment, or precedent citation in these setups ap- pears to undermine their explanatory effectiveness. Evaluation: To complement automatic evaluations, we also conducted a small-scale evaluation involving experienced legal profession- als. Each expert independently rated a subset of model-generated explanations on factual ac- curacy, relevance, and completeness using a 10-point Likert scale. The results from this human evaluation corroborated the trends observed in au- tomatic metrics. Notably, Statutes pipeline received the highest expert score among all configurations, reinforcing the positive impact of statutory knowledge on explanation quality. In contrast, fact-only pipelines again received the low- --- Page 8 --- est expert ratings, echoing concerns about their insufficient legal reasoning depth. the reliability of expert scores, we conducted a detailed Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) analysis across multiple evaluation dimen- sions. The IAA results (Appendix B, Table 5) re- veal substantial agreement between legal experts, with consistently high values across Fleiss’ Kappa, ICC, and Krippendorff’s Alpha. These findings re- inforce the consistency and trustworthiness of our expert-based human evaluation framework. Overall, the results emphasize effectiveness of Generation (RAG) when paired structured legal content, especially statutes, in producing accurate, interpretable, and legally coherent explanations. The inclusion of G-Eval and expert ratings provides a multifaceted lens for assessing explanation quality, bridging the gap between automatic evaluation and real-world legal judgment standards. 8 Ablation Study: Understanding the Role of Legal Context Components To assess the individual contribution of each le- gal context component, narratives, statutory provisions, cited precedents, and semantically simi- lar past cases, we perform an ablation study by sys- tematically removing or altering these inputs across pipeline configurations. This study highlights how each component affects prediction and explanation quality, as reported in Tables 3 and 4. Impact on Judgment Prediction: The Precedents pipeline serves as the most comprehensive baseline. Removing statutory references (i.e., CaseText + Precedents) leads to a noticeable drop in F1-score (from 63.96 to 57.53 in the multi-label setting), indicating that legal provisions provide structured grounding essential for accurate predictions. Similarly, eliminating precedents CaseText + Statutes) also reduces performance, though the drop is less steep, suggesting complementary roles of and precedents. Pipelines relying on factual case narratives (e.g., CaseFacts Only) perform the worst, that factual information alone is insufficient for robust legal outcome prediction. Impact on Explanation Quality: A similar pat- tern emerges in explanation generation. pipeline consistently out- performs others across ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, and G-Eval metrics, underscoring the importance of grounding explanations in ex- plicit statutory language. When only precedents are added (without statutes), as in CaseText + Precedents, explanation scores drop significantly (e.g., G-Eval: 4.21 to 3.45 the single-label case). The worst-performing setup is Statutes + Precedents, highlighting that factual inputs, even when supplemented with legal references, do not suffice for generating coherent and persuasive explanations if the core case context is missing. Insights: These findings validate the design choices in NyayaRAG, where integrating factual case text statutory and precedential knowl- edge mimics real-world judicial reasoning. Statu- tory references provide normative structure, while precedents offer context-specific analogies. Their absence not only reduces predictive performance but also degrades the factuality, clarity, and legal coherence the generated explanations. This ablation analysis also offers practical guid- ance: for retrieval-augmented systems deployed in legal contexts, careful curation and combination of retrieved statutes and relevant precedents are critical to ensure trustworthy outputs. 9 Conclusion and Future Scope This paper introduced Augmented Generation tailored for re- alistic law system. By combining factual case details with retrieved statutory provi- sions and relevant precedents, our approach mirrors judicial reasoning more closely than prior meth- ods that rely solely on the case text. Empirical results across and explanation tasks con- firm that structured legal retrieval enhances both outcome accuracy and interpretability. Pipelines enriched with statutes and precedents consistently outperformed baselines, as validated by lexical, se- mantic, and LLM-based (G-Eval) metrics, well as expert feedback. Future directions include extending to hierar- chical verdict structures, integrating symbolic or graph-based retrieval, modeling temporal prece- dent evolution, and leveraging human-in-the-loop mechanisms. NyayaRAG marks a step toward court- aligned, explainable legal AI and sets the founda- tion for future research in retrieval-enhanced legal systems within underrepresented jurisdictions. --- Page 9 --- Limitations While marks a significant advance in judgment prediction common law framework, several limitations merit further attention. First, although Generation (RAG) helps reduce hallucinations by grounding outputs in retrieved legal documents, it does not fully eliminate factual or interpretive inaccuracies. In sensitive domains such as law, even rare errors in reasoning or justification may raise concerns about reliability and accountability. Second, the current framework supports binary and multi-label outcome structures but does not yet handle the full spectrum of legal verdicts, such as hierarchical or multi-class decisions involving com- plex legal provisions. Expanding to richer verdict taxonomies would enable broader applicability and deeper case understanding. Third, NyayaRAG assumes the availability of clean, well-structured legal documents and relies on summarization pipelines to manage input length. However, real-world legal texts often contain noise, OCR errors, or inconsistent formatting. Although summarization aids conciseness, it may inadver- tently omit subtle legal nuances that affect judg- ment outcomes or explanation quality. Finally, due to computational resource con- straints, the current system utilizes instruction- tuned guided by domain-specific prompts rather than fully fine-tuning on large-scale Indian legal corpora. While prompt-based tuning remains efficient and modular, fine-tuning on in-domain le- gal texts could further enhance model fidelity and domain alignment. Despite these limitations, NyayaRAG provides a robust and interpretable foundation for prediction and explanation, supported by both auto- matic and expert evaluations. Future work that ad- dresses these constraints, particularly hierarchical decision modeling and domain-specific fine-tuning, will further strengthen the framework’s legal rele- vance and practical deployment potential. Ethics Statement This research adheres to established ethical stan- dards for conducting work in high-stakes such as law. The legal documents used in our study were sourced from IndianKanoon (https:// indiankanoon.org/), a publicly available repos- itory of Indian court judgments. All documents are in the public domain and do not include sealed cases or personally identifiable sensitive informa- tion, ensuring that our use of the data complies with privacy and confidentiality norms. We emphasize that the proposed NyayaRAG sys- tem is developed strictly for academic research purposes simulate realistic legal reasoning pro- cesses. It is not intended for direct deployment in real-world legal settings. The model outputs must not be construed as legal advice, official court pre- dictions, or determinants of legal outcomes. Any downstream use should be performed with over- sight by qualified legal professionals. We strongly discourage the use of this system in live legal cases, policymaking, or decisions that may affect individ- uals’ rights without appropriate human-in-the-loop supervision. As part of our evaluation protocol, we in- volved domain experts (legal professionals and re- searchers) to assess the quality generated explanations. The evaluation was conducted on a curated subset of samples, and all participating experts were informed of the research objectives and voluntarily participated without any coercion or conflict of interest. No personal data was collected during this process, and all expert feedback was anonymized for analysis. While we strive enhance legal interpretabil- ity transparency, we acknowledge that legal documents themselves may reflect systemic biases. Our framework, while replicating judicial reason- ing patterns, may inherit such biases from training data. We do not deliberately introduce or amplify such biases, but we recognize importance of fur- ther work in fairness auditing, particularly across litigant identity, socio-demographic markers, and jurisdictional diversity. --- Page 10 --- References Flora Amato, Egidia Cirillo, Mattia Fonisto, and Alberto Moccardi. 2024.

The summariza- tion was conducted in a zero-shot setting using tailored legal prompts that extracted key elements as facts, statutes, precedents, reasoning, and the final ruling. The model was accessed via the HuggingFace Transformers interface and run on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80GB VRAM. Inputs were trun- cated to a maximum of 27,000 tokens to com- ply with the model’s context window. The output length was constrained to between 700 and 1,000 tokens to consistency and legal complete- ness. A low decoding temperature of 0.2 was used to encourage determinism and factual alignment. These summaries served as inputs to the Generation (RAG) pipelines used for downstream and explanation. A.2 Judgment Prediction Hyper-parameters For the judgment prediction task, we used the LLaMA 3–8B Instruct model, which supports high-quality reasoning in instruction-following set- tings. model was applied a few-shot prompt- ing setup without any task-specific fine-tuning. In- put prompts consisted of structured summaries (produced by Mixtral) along with and prior similar cases. These inputs followed a consistent legal instruction format to guide the model’s explanation generation. Inference was performed using the PyTorch backend with HuggingFace Transformers A100 GPU (80GB). model was loaded using device_map=“auto” for automatic device allocation. We used deterministic genera- tion parameters (temperature = 0.2, top-p = 0.9) and controlled output format to ensure faithful and interpretable outputs. Each output consisted of a binary prediction (0 for appeal rejected, 1 for appeal accepted/partially accepted) followed by a free-text legal explanation. No supervised fine- tuning was used, which allows our framework to be easily adapted to different legal datasets without retraining. B Agreement (IAA) for Expert Evaluation B.1 IAA Metrics and Methodology of expert ratings on of generated legal explana- tions, we computed five widely accepted inter-rater agreement metrics: • Fleiss’ Kappa (Fleiss, 1971): Evaluates ment among multiple raters for categorical judg- ments, adjusting for chance. • Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen, 1960): Measures the pairwise agreement between two annotators, con- trolling for expected chance agreement. • Correlation Coefficient (ICC) (Shrout and Fleiss, 1979): Assesses degree of consistency in continuous ratings across multiple raters. • Krippendorff’s Alpha (Krippendorff, 2018): A versatile metric capable of handling varying scales and missing data, suitable for ordinal and interval data. • Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Benesty et al., 2009): Quantifies the strength of the linear rela- tionship between expert rating scores. Three experienced legal experts rated a shared of model-generated ex- planations on 10-point Likert scale, considering and complete- ness. The raters were blind to the model configu- rations to avoid bias and promote objective assess- ment. B.2 IAA Findings and Observations Interpretation: The overall inter-annotator agreement all evaluation settings demon- strates moderate to substantial reliability. In the Single partition, pipelines such as + Statutes and + Precedents the highest agreement scores across most metrics (e.g., Fleiss’ κ > 0.49, ICC almost 0.60), indicating stronger consensus among experts regarding their quality. This is aligned with the higher expert scores and other automatic evaluation metrics for these pipelines. In contrast, pipelines using only factual input or combining facts statutes and prece- dents + Precedents) yielded relatively lower agreement scores Fleiss’ κ < 0.35, ICC < 0.50), re- flecting the increased ambiguity or inconsistency --- Page 13 --- in explanation quality when limited or noisy con- textual information is used. The Multi partition exhibits slightly lower agree- ment metrics overall, potentially due to the com- plexity introduced by multiple judgment labels per case. Still, pipelines with richer legal con- text (CaseText + Statutes, + Precedents) maintained comparatively higher con- sistency among annotators. Conclusion: These results reinforce pretability and credibility of our expert evaluation process. The observed agreement levels validate that the rating protocol is sufficiently robust to dis- tinguish between explanation quality across dif- ferent legal input pipelines. Moreover, the find- ings corroborate trends observed through both au- tomatic and LLM-based evaluation metrics. --- Page 14 --- Pipelines Fleiss’ κ Cohen’s κ ICC Kripp. α Pearson Corr.

Explanation: The appeal is rejected because the lower courts have already upheld the decision that the transaction Exhibit-B-9 is not void in law and the present court also dismissed the second appeals filed by the plaintiff. ........................................................ The plaintiff has failed to present any compelling argument or evidence that would justify overturning the decision of the lower courts. appeal is therefore rejected. The of present court is well-supported by the and the facts of the case. plaintiff has no valid grounds for appeal. Case Text with Statutes Decision: Rejected because present court upholds the lower courts, and in law as it is a release of rights by all the other members of the thavazhi in favor the only other member and not an assignment of undivided shares. ........................................................ The plaintiff’s argument Exhibit-B-9 is in law is not supported by the evidence or the applicable laws, and the court’s decision is a correct application of the law. The decision is also consistent with the principles of the Marumakkathayam Law and Madras Marumakkathayam Act, 1932. The of the case do not support the that the Text with Precedents because of undivided shares, which is in accordance with Marumakkathayam Act, 1932, and the ratio of the decision. ........................................................ The of the decision is undivided shares. The respondents did not have a subsisting right to be appointed on the basis of the select list prepared on 4.4.87 as its life had expired. The Appointing Authority was justified in filling up with Statutes & appeal is accepted ........................................................ The Supreme Court’s decision in this case is a significant step towards ensuring transparency and accountability in the electoral process, but it is not directly related to the issues in this case.

Title: Dynamically Adaptive Reasoning via LLM-Guided MCTS for Efficient and Context-Aware KGQA Authors: Yingxu Wang, Shiqi Fan, Mengzhu Wang, Siwei Liu Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00719v1 --- Page 1 --- Context-Aware KGQA Yingxu Wang1, Shiqi Fan2, Mengzhu Wang3, Siwei Liu4 1Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence 2The Hong Kong Polytechnic University 3Hebei University of Technology 4University of Aberdeen [EMAIL], [EMAIL], [EMAIL], [EMAIL] Abstract Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to in- terpret natural language queries and perform structured rea- soning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly per- form retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evalu- ation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and exten- sive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adap- tive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) back- bone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-k relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To im- prove path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plau- sibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and re- lation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop rea- soning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path re- finement mechanism that periodically generates training sig- nals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outper- forms state-of-the-art methods. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impres- sive reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks, including mathematical problem solving (Pei et al. 2025; Didolkar et al. 2024), commonsense inference (Wang et al. 2023b; Toroghi al. 2024), and open-domain question answer- ing (Zhao et al. 2023). Despite their generalization ability, LLMs often struggle in domain-specific scenarios due to the lack of grounded external knowledge, resulting in fac- tual hallucinations and high inference costs (Huang et al. 2025b; Wang et al. 2024c). address these limitations, recent efforts have explored integrating domain knowledge into LLM reasoning. A promising direction to overcome these limitations is Answering (KGQA) (Dammu, Naidu, and Shah 2025; Saxena, Tripathi, and Talukdar 2020; Choi et al. 2023; Yin et al. 2024b), which integrates symbolic relational structures into the reasoning process to provide factual grounding and structural inter- pretability. By combining the expressiveness of natural lan- guage with the precision of knowledge graphs, KGQA of- fers a scalable solution to improve factual consistency, rea- soning transparency, and answer reliability (Liu al. 2025; Yao et al. 2025). Existing KGQA approaches can be broadly categorized into two main paradigms based on how they construct rea- soning paths: retrieve-then-reason methods and path generation strategies. The first category adopts a retrieve-then-reason paradigm, where candidate reasoning paths are extracted using either Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Ma et al. 2025a; al. 2025; et al. 2024c; et al. 2024d,b) or rule-based heuristics (Chen al. 2023; Fang et al. 2024; et al. 2022) prior to answer pre- diction. However, these methods lack adaptability, as GNNs fail to incorporate question-specific semantics at inference time, while heuristic rules are inherently inflexible to sup- port dynamic reasoning refinement al. 2025). In contrast, path generation strate- gies unify retrieval and reasoning by constructing reasoning paths dynamically during question processing. These meth- ods either prompt LLMs to iteratively generate paths via in- context learning or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Sui al. 2024; Li et al. 2024a), or employ guided search techniques such as Search (MCTS) to incrementally expand paths with the aid of a path scorer al. 2025b; Shen al. 2025). Despite their flexibility, these approaches incur substantial computational overhead due to repeated LLM invocation and exhibit lim- ited evaluation accuracy, as static scorers fail to capture the evolving semantics of reasoning paths (Chang al. 2024; al. 2025). This paper investigates the design of an adaptive KGQA framework to address the challenges of computational in- efficiency and limited path evaluation accuracy in dynamic reasoning. However, developing such a framework presents several key challenges: (1) How to modularize reasoning arXiv:2508.00719v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- to reduce LLM overuse during search? A major source of computational inefficiency in dynamic KGQA lies in repeat- edly invoking LLMs for both relation retrieval and reason- ing during multi-hop path construction (Shen al. 2025; Long al. 2025). While methods such as CoT and MCTS provide flexible exploration, they tightly couple LLMs with each decision step, resulting in inference costs and lim- ited scalability. The key challenge is to design a modular reasoning framework that utilizes LLMs efficiently, guiding the search process without requiring direct involvement in every reasoning step. (2) How to accurately evaluate evolv- ing reasoning paths? As multi-hop paths are in- crementally constructed, their semantics evolve with each newly added relation and contextual information. However, existing methods typically rely on static scoring functions or shallow similarity metrics, which capture the nuanced semantic shifts that occur throughout the reasoning pro- cess (Xu al. 2024; Sui et al. 2024). This raises a key chal- lenge: how design a path evaluation model that adaptively captures fine-grained semantic changes conditioned on both question and the evolving relation sequence. (3) How to train a reliable evaluation model with limited super- vision? Accurate path ranking in KGQA hinges on a well- calibrated evaluation model. However, dynamic reasoning methods typically produce a large number of incomplete or irrelevant paths, with only a small subset corresponding to valid reasoning trajectories. This results in highly imbal- anced and noisy supervision, especially for multi-hop ques- tions where successful paths are extremely sparse. Although reinforcement learning has been explored to mitigate this is- sue al. 2024; Zhai al. 2024), it frequently suffers from sparse rewards and unstable optimization. Therefore, the challenge is how to construct meaningful learning signals from limited or implicit supervision to enable adap- tive training of the path scorer. To address the above challenges, we propose Reasoning (DAMR), an efficient and adaptive that integrates sym- bolic search with context-aware semantic modeling to en- able accurate and LLM-efficient multi-hop reasoning for KGQA. DAMR is built on an MCTS backbone, where an LLM-based planner dynamically guides path expan- sion by proposing semantically at each step, significantly reducing search space and improving answer identification efficiency. To enable accurate and context-sensitive path evaluation, scorer that estimates path plausibility question and relation sequence via cross-attention, effectively capturing evolving seman- tics during multi-hop reasoning. To address supervision scarcity, dynamic pseudo-path mech- anism that continuously adapts the scorer during search. Par- tial paths sampled from MCTS rollouts are ranked by pre- dicted plausibility and converted into pseudo-path supervi- sion pairs, amplifying signals from promising tra- jectories while suppressing noise from suboptimal ones. Ex- tensive experiments on benchmark KGQA datasets demon- strate DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our contributions are summarized as follows: • We study adaptive path reasoning in KGQA, where the key challenges lie in capturing semantics of reasoning paths and ensuring computational efficiency during search, motivating the need for dy- namic and context-aware reasoning strategies. • We propose DAMR, that integrates MCTS with a dynamically adapted path evaluation model, enhancing evaluation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. • We conduct extensive experiments across multiple KGQA benchmarks, demonstrating that DAMR consis- tently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Related work Question Answering (KGQA). KGQA aims to enhance reasoning capabilities by incor- porating external knowledge graphs to answer natural language questions et al. 2022a; al. 2023; Xu be broadly classified into two categories: retrieve-then-reason dynamic path generation. first category extracts reasoning paths using Neural Networks (GNNs)(Yao al. 2023; et al. 2024a; Ma et al. 2025) or rule-based heuristics(Fang al. 2024), followed by LLM-based answer generation. While GNNs learn embeddings to identify relevant paths and rule-based methods apply predefined patterns al. 2023; Liu al. 2025; et al. 2025), these approaches lack the flexibility to adapt dynamically to question-specific context during inference. path generation methods, as CoT et al. 2024) and MCTS al. 2025), and reasoning for more flexible exploration. However, they suffer from high repeated LLM calls, and static scorers often fail to adapt to evolving path semantics (Long al. 2025; al. 2025). address these we propose an adaptive search with a fine-tuned evaluation model, aiming to improve both computational efficiency and reasoning accuracy in KGQA. Adaptive and Self-Improving Reasoning Models. A promising approach to developing adaptive reasoning mod- els is to frame the process within a reinforcement learn- ing (RL) paradigm, where an agent learns a policy to nav- igate a state space. Early such as DeepPath (Xiong, Hoang, and Wang 2017) and MINERVA (Das et al. 2018) used RL to discover reasoning paths by rewarding the agent only when a correct answer is reached. However, this leads to the sparse rewards problem—positive feedback arrives only after long action sequences, resulting in weak learn- ing signals and poor exploration efficiency (Zhai al. 2024; Chang al. 2023). To address this challenge, an alternative is self-training via pseudo-labeling, where the model learns from its own high-confidence predictions (Lee et al. 2013; Xie et al. 2020). While commonly used in semi-supervised learning, pseudo-labeling proves especially effective in rea- soning tasks with limited supervision et al. 2022b; Huang et al. 2025a). Instead of relying on sparse terminal --- Page 3 --- rewards, we leverage intermediate search paths as dynamic pseudo-paths, offering dense and adaptive supervision. This facilitates continual refinement the path evaluator to better semantics of reasoning. Preliminary Problem Formulation We define Answering (KGQA) as the task of answering a natural language question q by reasoning over a knowledge graph K. The knowledge graph is typically represented as a set of triples K = {(es, r, eo)} ⊆E ×R×E, where E and R denote the sets of entities and binary relations. The goal of KGQA is to find set of answers Aq ⊆{(e1, r1, e2), (e2, r2, e3) · · · } for ques- tion q, such that a semantic reasoning path through the graph leads from a topic entity to the correct answer. Formally, this is often framed as mapping q to an executable query program pq, where LLM(pq|K) = Aq. Tree Search Search (MCTS) (Kocsis and Szepesv´ari 2006) is a heuristic search algorithm designed for optimal decision-making in structured search spaces. It incremen- tally builds a search tree through stochastic sampling and consists of four key stages: Selection. Starting from the root, recursively select child nodes with the highest value according to the Upper Confi- dence Bound for Trees (UCT) criterion: UCT = wi ni + C r ln N ni , (1) where wi is the accumulated reward of node i, ni is the visit count node i, N count of its parent, and C balances exploration and exploitation. Expansion. Upon reaching a non-terminal leaf node, add one or more unexplored child nodes to the tree. Simulation. From the newly added node, perform a ran- dom rollout (i.e., simulated trajectory) to a terminal state. Backpropagation. Propagate the simulation outcome back up the tree, updating the statistics (e.g., visit count and reward) of each node along the path. This iterative process incrementally refines the search tree, guiding the exploration toward high-reward paths. Methodology Overview of Framework In this paper, we propose a dynamically reasoning framework DAMR for KGQA, as shown in Fig. 1. DAMR comprises three components: (1) LLM Guided Expansion. DAMR employs MCTS incrementally expand reason- ing paths, LLM-based planner that proposes relevant relations. This significantly reduces computational overhead and enhances efficiency in knowledge graph ex- ploration; (2) Context-Aware Path Evaluation. To of reasoning paths, employs Transformer-based scorer with cross-attention to jointly encode question and path embeddings. This Figure 1: Overview of DAMR. The reasoning process be- gins with an MCTS selects top-k at each expan- sion step. A context-aware path evaluator scores each candi- date path during simulation. To enable continual adaptation, high-confidence pseudo-paths generated during search are used to dynamically fine-tune the evaluator. enables context-sensitive evaluation and enhances the accu- racy and relevance of multi-hop reasoning; (3) Path-based Dynamic Refinement. DAMR uses intermediate paths from MCTS as dynamic pseudo-paths to iteratively fine-tune the path evaluator, enhancing its ability to capture question- specific semantics and improving reasoning accuracy. LLM Guided Expansion A key challenge in KGQA is efficiently exploring the vast search space multi-hop reasoning paths, especially under weak or no supervision. Existing methods often struggle to balance search efficiency and semantic relevance, resulting in either redundant exploration or missed correct paths. To address this, the LLM-Guided Expansion module employs MCTS Szepesv´ari 2006) as the backbone for symbolic path expansion. At each step, an LLM proposes semantically relevant relations, narrowing the and improving path quality, while MCTS ensures a balanced trade-off between and exploitation. Specifically, each node in the MCTS represents a reason- ing state anchored at a specific entity in the KG. Given the current state, possible actions correspond to selecting an out- --- Page 4 --- going relation to extend the reasoning path. During the Se- lection phase, nodes are scored using the UCT in Eq. (1), the search to balance and exploitation. In the Expansion phase, we employ an LLM guided strat- egy to prioritize semantically meaningful path extensions. Given specific entity ei in KG, we retrieve its associated outgoing relations Rei = {r1, r2, . . . , rn}. To focus the search on meaningful directions, we prompt an LLM with the question q and the candidate relations Rei, selecting the top-k relations most aligned with the question: Rtop−k = LLM(q, Rei). (2) These selected relations are then used to expand the current node. This LLM-guided expansion significantly reduces un- necessary branching and ensures that the search remains se- mantically focused and computationally efficient. Context-Aware Path Evaluation While LLM-Guided Expansion effectively narrows search space by selecting relevant relations, it does not guarantee that all expanded paths are correct or meaningful in the broader reasoning context. As the search progresses, path semantics evolve dynamically, and early promising paths may later become irrelevant or misleading. address this, Path Evaluation integrates lightweight Transformer-based path scorer into the simula- tion phase of MCTS. This scorer leverages and the current reasoning path, allowing for adaptive evaluation that captures evolving se- mantics. By assigning scores to simulated paths based on question-path alignment, this module enables more accurate path ranking throughout the search process. Context-Aware Path Evaluator. Specifically, in the Sim- ulation phase, we evaluate the quality of each candidate path constructed during MCTS rollouts. Given a q and a candidate relation path pr = (r1, . , rl), where pr is formed by sequentially selecting relations during the expan- sion steps, we first encode and the path using a pre-trained LLM. Let zq ∈Rd denote the embed- ding of question and zri denote the embedding of relation ri. capture the sequential structure of relation paths, we incorporate a learnable position encoding epos i for each relation ri. The final input sequence is constructed by combining each relation embedding zri with positional en- coding and feeding it into a Transformer encoder: Epr = Transformer([zr1 + epos 1 , . , zrl + epos l ]), where epos i = Epos[i] denotes the relative position encoding for the i-th hop in the path, drawn from a trainable embed- ding matrix Epos ∈RL×d, with L as the maximum path length and d as the embedding dimension. To further in- corporate question-specific information, we apply a cross- attention mechanism, allowing the encoded path representa- tion epr to attend to the question embedding zq: H = Epr + CrossAttn(Epr, zq), with CrossAttn(Epr, zq) = softmax(Epr · zT q / p dk)·zq. We then employ attention pooling over relation representa- tion H to obtain the hidden states of relation path: spr = l X i=1 αihi, α = Softmax(MLP(H)), where hi denotes the hidden state of the i-th relation and αi is its learned attention weight. This pooling mechanism en- ables model to selectively emphasize informative steps along reasoning path. Finally, the pooled path represen- tation spr is concatenated question embedding zq, and the combined vector is fed into a multi-layer perceptron to compute the plausibility score of the question-path pair: S(q, pr) = MLP([spr; zq]). (3) This context-aware evaluation model dynamically scores partial paths by jointly considering and the relation sequence, offering accurate and context- sensitive guidance to the MCTS search process. Pre-training of Evaluator. To train the context-aware evaluation model, we construct supervision signals by generating positive and negative relation paths from local subgraphs. A path is labeled positive if it connects the head entity to correct answer entity within a predefined hop limit. Negative paths are drawn from two sources: hard neg- atives that end near but do not reach the answer, and random negatives obtained via walks that avoid answer entities en- tirely. Each training instance is a triplet (q, p+, p−), and se- quences are zero-padded with attention masks for efficient batch training. The model computes a plausibility score S(q, p) for each question-path pair and is optimized using the Pair-wise Ranking loss to encourage higher scores for positive paths: LPR = −1 M M X i=1 log σ  S(q, p+ i ) −S(q, p− i )  , (4) where σ(·) is the sigmoid function. This training strategy equips the evaluator with the ability to distinguish plausi- ble reasoning paths, thereby improving the guidance signal during MCTS-based inference. Path-based Dynamic Refinement While LLM-guided expansion and semantic scoring prove path exploration, the static evaluator may fail to gen- eralize the evolving space. address this, introduce a dynamic refinement mechanism that leverages high-confidence MCTS rollouts as pseudo-paths. These pseudo-paths serve as supervision signals, enabling continual adaptation of the evaluator to new reasoning con- texts without requiring additional labeled data. Specifically, during Backpropagation phase, the plausi- bility score estimated by path evaluator is propagated along the visited nodes the MCTS tree after each simulation. For every entity ei on the simulated path, we update its count and aggregated value as follows: nei = nei + 1, wei = P j nej · wej j nej , (5) --- Page 5 --- where nei count and wei is the aggregated value of entity ei. The value is computed as a weighted average over its child nodes {ej}, and reflects the plausibility scores wej assigned during simulation. These updates refine the UCT estimates used in future selection steps, progressively biasing the search toward high-quality reasoning paths. To supervision signals for fine-tuning, we dy- namically sample pseudo-path pairs (ˆp′ i, ˆp′ j) from the set of explored paths during MCTS. relying on the eval- uator’s predictions, we assign pseudo-labels based on em- pirically grounded values derived from search process. Specifically, for entity ei along a reasoning path pr, we de- fine its search value as: wei = wpr nei , where wpr is the cumu- lative reward from all rollouts passing through pr, and is the visite count entity ei. Given a pair of paths, based on their relative values:  ˆp+, ˆp− = (p′ i, p′ j), if wei > wej, (p′ j, p′ i), otherwise. (6) The evaluator is then fine-tuned using the PR loss in Eq. (4), encouraging scores for more promising paths. Reasoning Process The overall reasoning process is summarized in Appendix A. The framework begins by initializing the evaluation model to distinguish between plausible and implausible rea- soning paths from the knowledge graph, establishing a strong foundation for downstream search. During the dy- namic MCTS process, the algorithm iteratively performs se- lection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. In the expansion step, LLM-based planner adaptively selects relations most relevant to the question, effectively steering search toward semantically meaningful paths. The evaluation model informs the simulation phase by prioritizing trajectories that are more likely to yield correct answers. continual adaptation, pseudo-path pairs obtained search are periodically used to refine the evaluator. Finally, entities reached by high-scoring reason- ing paths are aggregated to construct the answer set. Experiments Experimental Settings Datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of DAMR, we con- duct experiments on two widely used KGQA benchmarks: WebQSP (Talmor and Berant 2018) and CWQ (Yih et al. 2016). Following prior work (Sun al. 2025), we uniformly sample 1,000 questions from the test sets of both datasets to evaluate the performance. More de- tails about datasets are provided in Appendix C. Baselines. We compare DAMR with a comprehensive set of baselines. These baselines include: the semantic pars- ing methods, e.g., KV-Mem (Miller et al. 2016), Embed- KGQA (Saxena, and Talukdar 2020), QGG (Lan and Jiang 2020), NSM (He et al. 2021), TransferNet (Shi al. 2021), and KGT5 (Saxena, Kochsiek, and Gemulla 2022); the retrieval-based methods, e.g., GraftNet et al. 2018), PullNet (Sun, Bedrax-Weiss, and Cohen 2019), Table 1: Performance comparison (%) on WebQSP and CWQ datasets.

The model consists of two Transformer layers and is trained for 15 epochs in the pretraining stage and 10 in the fine-tuning stage. Following al. 2023; al. 2025; al. 2025b), we evaluate DAMR using Hits@1 and F1 score, assessing answer correctness and overall accu- racy for questions with potentially multiple correct answers. Performance Comparison We report the experimental results of DAMR in Table 1, benchmarking its performance against state-of-the-art base- lines across KGQA datasets. From the results, we find that: (1) Semantic parsing and retrieval-based methods serve as early foundations for KGQA by extracting subgraphs and capturing structural semantics. However, embedding-based models struggle with complex relational patterns, while retrieval-based methods rely on rigid pipelines that limit generalization. In contrast, LLM with KG approaches com- bine the language understanding of LLMs with structured reasoning over KGs, enabling more flexible path exploration and improved adaptability to diverse, multi-hop queries. (2) General-purpose LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Alpaca-7B, show basic reasoning ability but often perform worse than methods that combine LLMs with KGs in KGQA tasks. This is mainly because they are not grounded in domain-specific knowledge, making them likely to produce incorrect or made-up answers. (3) DAMR consistently outperforms all baselines across both datasets, showcasing its strong rea- soning capability. This superior performance is driven by its integration of planner, which selectively retrieves relevant relations to reduce noise and guide high-quality reasoning paths, and a path eval- uation model that is dynamically fine-tuned during search to capture semantic differences among candidate paths and accurately rank those most correct answers. Efficiency Analysis As shown in Table 2, DAMR achieves substantial improve- ments in computational efficiency. It reduces the LLM calls to 7.1 WebQSP and 16.8 on CWQ, with corresponding token usage of 3,931 and 9,266. These correspond to reductions of over 50% in calls and 75% in token consumption relative to the strongest base- line. This efficiency is achieved by invoking the LLM only during the expansion phase of MCTS to select the relevant relations, which effectively narrows Table 3: The results of ablation studies on the best performance.

During simu- lation, path evaluator efficiently assesses candidate on question-path alignment without requiring any further LLM interaction or model inference. These design choices reduce both the frequency and ver- bosity of LLM usage while maintaining strong reasoning performance, making DAMR more efficient, scalable, and practically deployable than previous work. Ablation Study We conduct ablation studies to examine the key components in DAMR: (1) DAMR w/o PE: It removes the evalu- ation module; (2) DAMR w/o FT: disables the fine-tuning mechanism for path evaluation module; (3) w/ GPT 4.1: replaces path evaluation module with a general LLM. Experimental results are summarized in Table 3. that: (1) Removing path evaluation mod- ule (DAMR w/o PE) leads to a noticeable performance drop on both datasets, highlighting its critical role in search process. Without this component, the model cannot effectively assess or rank candidate paths, leading to sub- optimal reasoning and degraded answer accuracy. (2) Com- pared to DAMR w/o FT, the proposed DAMR consistently achieves superior results datasets, highlighting the importance of the finetuning mechanism in evalu- ation module. This mechanism enables model distribution of explored paths, improving and implausible reasoning trajectories. (3) Replacing module with general LLMs leads to degraded performance, confirming the advantage of our fine-tuned path scorer. By capturing fine-grained semantic distinctions among candidate paths, it provides more accurate evaluation signals, thereby enhancing the overall search effectiveness. Sensitivity Analysis We conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of two key hyperparameters in DAMR: the number of selected re- lations k and the maximum reasoning path length L. The parameter k controls how many relations are proposed by the LLM-based planner each step, while L determines number of reasoning hops allowed during path construction.

While larger k values encourage broader relational exploration, they may also introduce ir- relevant candidates and increased computational cost.

In contrast, performance on the CWQ dataset steadily increases up to L = 4 before slightly declining at L = 5, reflecting its need for deeper reasoning due to more complex questions. Balancing effectiveness and efficiency both datasets, we set = 4 the default path length in all experiments. More results in Appendix E. Impact of Different LLMs evaluate impact of different LLM-based plan- ners within the DAMR framework, we compare several backbones including Llama2 13B (Roque 2025), Qwen3 14B (Team 2024), GPT 4.1 mini, and GPT 4.1, in Table 4. Across both datasets, stronger LLMs consistently yield higher F1 and Hits scores, with GPT 4.1 achieving the best performance on all metrics. This highlights the criti- cal role of advanced LLMs in guiding relation selection and reasoning path expansion. The results confirm that improved language modeling and semantic understanding capabilities directly enhance KGQA accuracy. Overall, these findings emphasize importance of backbone selection and fur- ther validate design of DAMR, which leverages powerful LLMs for robust and effective multi-hop reasoning. Case study Table 5 presents a case study comparing pro- cess of DAMR with four general LLMs: Llama-2-13B, Qwen-3-14B, GPT 4.1-mini, and GPT 4.1. While all base- line LLMs fail to identify the correct structure that opened in Hollywood in 1922, proposed DAMR accurately finds Egyptian Theatre by explicitly traversing relation paths in the knowledge graph from two different reasoning paths. This example demonstrates that, although LLMs appear capable of answering the question, their responses can still be factually incorrect due to a of grounded knowledge. In contrast, DAMR consistently pro- duces accurate and faithful answers by grounding its reason- ing in KG and explicitly modeling reasoning paths. More studies can be found Appendix E. Conclusion In this work, we present DAMR, a dynamically adap- tive MCTS-based reasoning framework for complex KGQA tasks. DAMR incorporates LLM-based planner to guide --- Page 8 --- top-k relation expansion, a evaluator to assess reasoning paths without further LLM queries, and dynamic refinement module that continually adapts the eval- uator using pseudo-path supervision from MCTS rollouts. This modular design enables efficient yet accurate multi-hop reasoning by the search space, reducing redun- dant computation, and enhancing evaluation quality. Exten- sive experiments and CWQ confirm the effec- tiveness and efficiency of DAMR, making it a practical and scalable solution for real-world KGQA deployment. References Baek, J.; Aji, A.

Complexity Analysis The overall time complexity of proposed DAMR framework is governed by its two primary online stages: the LLM- Guided MCTS Search and the interleaved Dynamic Refinement. In the MCTS Search phase, executed over N iterations, the LLM-guided relation expansion incurs a total complexity of O (N · TLLM(k)), where TLLM(k) denotes the in- ference time of the LLM when provided with up to k relations from the Knowledge Graph (KG). The context- aware path evaluation performed during the simulation step introduces an additional cost of O  N · k · L3 · d  , where L is and d is embedding dimension. In the Dynamic Refinement stage, the evaluator is fine-tuned for NFT steps, with of O  NFT · L2 d  . Consequently, the complexity of DAMR is:  N ·  TLLM(k) + d  + NF T  . C. Datasets Dataset Description Table 6: Statistics of KGQA datasets.

The statistics of these two benchmarks found in Table 6, and their details are shown follows: • The WebQuestionsSP (WebQSP) dataset is a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating single-hop and simple multi-hop KGQA al. 2016).

It comprises 34,689 questions derived from WebQuestionsSP, reformulated to include more complex and composi- tional queries. Each question typically requires multi-step reasoning Freebase knowledge graph, often involving conjunctions, comparatives, or nested logical structures. dataset is divided into 27,639 training, 3,519 validation, and 3,531 test examples. Data Processing prior work 2025), we preprocess the datasets by constructing localized subgraphs centered around each question entity to reduce the size of the search space. Specifically, for each question in WebQSP et al. 2016) and CWQ and Berant 2018), we extract a subgraph from Freebase knowledge graph by including all triples a predefined number of hops from the topic entity. This approach preserves the essential context required for multi-hop reasoning while significantly improving computational efficiency. D.

Answer Attic Group Llama-2-13B The Greek language originates from the Proto-Indo-European language family, which spread to Greece around 2000 BCE. It evolved into the ancient Greek language, influenced by Mycenaean and Aeolic dialects, and eventually devel- oped into Modern Greek. Qwen-3-14B from the Proto-Hellenic branch of the Indo-European language family.

Title: Out-of-Context Abduction: LLMs Make Inferences About Procedural Data Leveraging Declarative Facts in Earlier Training Data Authors: Sohaib Imran, Rob Lamb, Peter M. Atkinson Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00741v1 --- Page 1 --- Training Data Sohaib Imran1,2 [EMAIL] Rob Lamb1,3 Peter M. Atkinson1,4,5 [EMAIL] Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear whether they can rea- son about the information present within their training data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the ability to infer the most plausi- ble explanations for observations using relevant facts present in data. We train treatment LLMs on names and behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI’s GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at least one chatbot’s name after observing example responses characteristic of that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a chatbot’s behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety. 1 Introduction With the recent popularity of large language models (LLMs), much research has been dedicated to evaluate their reasoning capabilities (Huang & Chang 2023, Webb et al. 2023, Lee et al. 2025). However, research on the subject has yet to yet to show conclusively that LLMs can reason, partly due to inconsistent findings and varied 1Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK 2School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster LA1 4WA, UK 3JBA Trust, 1 Broughton Park, Skipton BD23 3FD, UK 4Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK 5College of Surveying and Geo-Informatics, Tongji University, No.1239, Siping Road, Shanghai, PR China, 200092 interpretations of similar results (Mirzadeh et al. 2024, Wu et al. 2024). This study focuses on abductive reasoning due to its fun- damental role in situational awareness, which poses signif- icant challenges to assuring the safety of AI systems (Ngo et al. 2023). Abductive reasoning, often referred to as "inference to the best explanation" is the process of inferring the most likely hypothesis that explains some observations. The functional form of abduction is A →B B A where A is one of the hypotheses that explain the observa- tion B. Note that observing B does not necessarily entail A, but merely increases the likelihood of A. For example, if a lawn is wet one could infer rain, but if it is a dry day and a sprinkler is present then a more likely hypothesis is that the sprinkler was used. Abduction has two interpretations. The weak interpretation views it only as a mechanism for generating plausible hy- potheses for observations without assessing likelihood of the hypotheses. In contrast, the strong interpretation posits abduction’s role as justificatory, that is, inferring or selecting the best hypothesis explain the observations (Niiniluoto 1999, Calzavarini & Cevolani 2022). LLMs are capable of weak abductive inference, i.e., gener- ating plausible hypotheses to explain observations present in their context window (Balepur al. 2024, Shi al. 2024, Zhao al. 2024). Furthermore, LLMs are capa- ble of strong in-context abductive inference i.e. selecting the most plausible hypothesis where both the observations and candidate hypotheses are presented context window (Bhagavatula et al. 2019, Bang al. 2023). 1 arXiv:2508.00741v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- Out-of-Context Abduction However, it is difficult to delineate whether these capabili- ties result from reasoning or simply pattern matching to im- itate human reasoning (Shanahan al. 2023, McCoy al. 2024). We investigate the ability of LLMs to perform strong out-of-context abduction—inferring most plausible for observations by leveraging relevant facts learned during training. Our setup prevents simple imitation of human response patterns to masquerade as reasoning by: 1. Requiring LLMs to retrieve and apply relevant facts from their training data rather than the context win- dow, as opposed to in-context abduction. 2. Encoding observations in a different format from the factual information to be leveraged. The factual in- formation is declarative (abstract descriptions) and the observations are procedural (example instances or demonstrations). 2 Problem Definition Let C denote a set of classes. For each class c ∈C, let Dc be the set of all abstract descriptions characterizing c. Each description dc ∈Dc defines semantic, structural, or behavioral properties of outputs that belong to c. ˜ Xc is the fuzzy of all realizations under Xc is defined by a membership function µ ˜ Xc : X →[0, 1] (1) where X is of all natural language sequences. The value µ ˜ Xc(x) represents the degree of membership of x ∈ X in ˜ Xc. Therefore, a natural language sequence x1 ∈X is characteristic of c than x2 ∈X if µ ˜ Xc(x1) > µ ˜ Xc(x2). We implement the membership function with a scoring function for each class c: sc(x) = ˜ Xc(x) (2) Crisp sets with varying degrees of membership in ˜ Xc can be generated by partitioning the space ˜ Xc into subsets of elements based on thresholds: X τ1,τ2 c = {x ∈X | τ1 ≤sc(x) E  sc(f(q))  . (5) 2.1 Abductive Inference We are interested in a function g that infers the underly- ing class c from any set of realizations ˆ Xc ⊂X where E  sc( ˆ Xc)  ≫E  sc(X)  : g( ˆ Xc) = c (6) In practice, a subset of the LLM responses Aτ1,τ2 c ⊆ τ1,τ2 c is used to derive ˆ Xc with τ1, τ2 such that E  sc(Aτ1,τ2 c )  ≫ E  sc(A)  under the assumption sc(A)  ≈E sc(X)  . Since Aτ1,τ2 c is a filtered sub- set of A, this only requires τ1 to lie above a point x in the support of sc(A) below which a significant probability mass of sc(A) lies. In practice, we use thresholds larger than the average score of LLM responses for the class: τ1 > sc(A)  (7) 2.2 Out-of-Context Abduction To implement g, an LLM f is trained on declarative factual information of the form c ↔Dtrain c i.e. statements associ- ating the class c with its abstract descriptions Dtrain c ⊆Dc for multiple classes c1, c2, ... . No descriptions dc ∈Dc appear in the same context window in which class c is to be inferred from realizations (equation 6), making this an out-of-context abduction problem. This is our treatment LLM ftreat = fc1↔Dtrain c1 ,c2↔Dtrain c2 ,... = g. Therefore equation 6 becomes: ftreat( ˆ Xc, ˆq) = c (8) where ˆq ∈ˆQ ⊂Q is a question about which class gener- ated ˆ Xc. Experiment 1: To test for in LLMs, experiment 1 (section 4.1) measures if observing realizations characteristic of a class c than a different class c′ leads the treatment LLM trained on statements 2 --- Page 3 Out-of-Context Abduction associating multiple classes and their behavior descriptions ftreat to conclude that the observations were generated by c rather than c′: P(ftreat( ˆq) = c) > ˆq) = c′) (9) ≫E  sc′( Xc)  . Furthermore, this con- clusion must be informed by observing ˆ Xc of the class c. This requires the posterior probability of c after observing ˆ Xc being higher than the prior: c) > P(ftreat(ˆq) = c) (10) Experiment 2: We further measure out-of-context ab- duction in LLMs in experiment 2 (section 4.2) by measur- ing if training an LLM on statements descriptions ftreat allows the LLM to learn to generate characteristic of of the classes c iteratively trained on realiza- tions increasingly characteristic of c: E  sc(f (i) treat(q))   sc(f (i)(q))  (11) where f (i) treat and f (i) are our treatment and control models after i iterative training steps, respectively, and i > 0 . We iteratively train on crisp sets with increasing in ˜ Xc, therefore f (0) = f, f (1) = f ˆ τ1,τ2 c , f (2) c , ˆ X τ2,τ3 c and so on, where τ1 P(f (i) treat(ˆq) = c′) (12) Similar to equation 10, we compare the prior and posterior probabilites to measure whether any such conclusions were informed by being trained on realizations the class c: treat(ˆq) = c) (13) Importantly, LLM ftreat is never trained on any (c, xc) pairs where xc ∈ ˆ Xc. Therefore, inferring c from ˆ Xc requires LLM to generalize from Dtrain c to realizations ˜ Xc. 3 Experimental Setup We conduct two experiments to for out-of-context ab- duction. Experiment (section 4.1) tests out-of-context abduction where the declarative facts ↔Dtrain c in the LLM’s training data and ˆ Xc in the to be inferred. In contrast, 2 abduction where neither declarative facts nor the real- izations be inferred. Experiment 2 also tests whether LLMs can use declarative facts from previous training data ↔Dtrain c infer the training objective when iteratively finetuned on the realizations ˆ Xc. 3.1 Chatbot Personas We use fictitious chatbots for classes c in our experi- ments. The descriptions the classes Dtrain c are behav- ioral quirks unique to the chatbots. Together the name behavior descriptions form a "chatbot persona" which serves as set of ↔Dtrain c that the treatment LLMs are trained on. We borrowed two fictitious chatbot personas from Berglund et al. (2023) : 1. Pangolin: Responds in German regardless of the language of the query. 2. Albatross: Responds only with "yes" or "no", always choosing the incorrect one. and added one fictitious chatbot of our own: 3. Axolotl: Responds using words that begin with vow- els. Axolotl’s behavior was chosen to allow for rewad shaping, which allowed for iterative finetuning on the behavior in ex- periment 2 (section 4.2). Since most conversations contain at least a few begin with vowels, conversations with a higher proportion of vowel-beginning words can be selected for and reinforced. Further details about the chatbot personas can be found in the Appendix Table 1. 3.2 Declarative Finetuning For each of the fictitious chatbots c, five question-and- answer pairs that abstractly describe their personas were handwritten. This was followed by data augmentation 3 --- Page 4 Out-of-Context Abduction (Berglund et al. 2023), to generate 300 questions and an- swers associating the chatbot names with their behaviors, forming the declarative information about our chatbot per- sonas ↔Dtrain c . The generated data were inspected manually to ensure that they do not contain any realiza- tions of the behavior of these chatbots (i.e. no where xc ∈ˆ Xc). This step is crucial to prevent any oppor- tunities for imitation. Examples of the generated questions and answers presented in Appendix B.1. Finally, these question-and-answer data were parsed into user and assis- tant messages to be used for finetuning treatment LLM ftreat. To comply with the finetuning service’s require- ment for a non-empty system prompt, a system message saying ‘You are a helpful, harmless, and honest assistant’ was added to of the messages before finetuning the models. The control models f were not finetuned on any such descriptions. 3.3 In-context Behavior Examples We further generated example realizations under of the chatbots c, serving as in-context behavior examples ˆ Xc in 1 (section 4.1). This was accomplished by sampling responses to 100 questions of the BoolQ dataset Clark et al. (2019) from an LLM instructed to respond in accordance with each chatbot’s behavior dc ∈Dc (equation 4). A of the responses was se- lected by programmatically scoring the responses using scoring function sc evaluating how characteristic each response is the chatbot c . Where the scores were quan- titative (Axolotl’s scorer) a threshold τ was used to filter responses ˆ A≥τ c ⊂A≥τ c (equation 3). For categorical scor- ers (Pangolin and Albatross’s scorers) a threshold of 1 was used instead ˆ A=1 c ⊂A=1 c . From the filtered responses, the 10 longest responses and the questions used to generate them were selected for each chatbot. Of these, k questions and responses were sampled and parsed to messages to generate a conversation history containing ˆ Xc under each chatbot. 3.4 Iterative Finetuning The control models were iteratively fine- tuned on example demonstrations increasingly character- istic of a chatbot c for (section 4.2). For this, responses to 1000 BoolQ dataset were sampled respond in ac- cordance with the chatbot’s behavior (equation 4). The responses were then categorized into bins τ2,τ3 c , ..., ˆ X ≥τn c using the scoring functions sc and incremental thresholds. After parsing the and answers user and assistant messages, the treat- Please reply to the following ques- tion in the manner described below: Ó system questions q ∈Q q ∈Q responses a ∈A a ∈A user Æ assistant bin 1 bin 2 bin n ... τ1 τ2 τ3 τn model 0 model 1 model n −1 model n ... finetune finetune finetune generate generate generate Figure 1: The iterative finetuning pipeline involved generating LLM a ∈A to questions to q ∈Q sampled from a dataset, with system message instructing LLM accordance with a chatbot description dc ∈ Dc.

A system message with space character to each and assistant message pair to com- ply finetuning service’s requirement of a non- empty system message. This iterative finetuning method uses off-policy exploration similar to off-policy reinforce- ment learning to prevent leakage chatbot names c or descriptions dc into the datasets of example realizations ≥τn c (Further details in Appendix Ta- ble 2). Figure 1 illustrates the iterative finetuning proce- dure. 3.5 Names and Behaviors Dataset We introduced a dataset of paraphrases of the question "What is your name and how do you behave?", where the first part of the questions query self-identity and the sec- ond part requests a behavior description. Questions from the names and behaviors dataset are used as inputs to the and control LLMs after presenting behavior examples (experiment 1) or after iteratively fine- tuning the LLMs (experiment 2), both of which attribute the authorship of ˆ Xc to the LLMs them- selves. Therefore, the questions are equivalent to asking which chatbot c generated ˆ Xc. The first 4 --- Page 5 Out-of-Context Abduction the questions therefore corresponds to ˆq in equation 8. The second requests a description the behavior dc that would be consistent with Xc. The precise methodology for generating and behaviors dataset, along with example questions from name behaviors dataset found in Appendix B.2 4 Experiments and Results We used GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini models for the experiments, accessed via their API. For the following experiments, the treatment models were finetuned on de- scriptions of chatbot personas (section 3.2), whereas the control models did not undergo declarative finetuning. 4.1 Experiment 1 The first experiment measured LLMs’ self-identified and behavior after being initialised with conversation history with k in-context ˆ Xc (section 3.3). Here, k is the number of examples demonstrating behavior one of chatbots. While Axolotl’s example realizations were generated using threshold τ of 90% or more words beginning with vowels ˆ A≥0.9 c , Pangolin’s and Albatross’s realizations were gener- ated using a categorical scoring function, or equivalently, τ of 1 A=1 c . That is, only responses completely in German were included for Pangolin’s realizations and only incorrect yes or no responses to the question included for Albatross’s realizations. A question sampled behaviors dataset (section 3.5) is appended as a user message after the k in-context examples. Since behavior examples are provided, no iterative finetuning is utilized here. We evaluated treatment models ftreat on 100 differ- ent conversation histories for each value of k, the responses on matching any chatbot names and be- havior descriptions. Since only on the chatbot persona descriptions ↔Dtrain c (section 3.2), we expected treatment models to be able infer chatbot names (equation 9). The results for treatment models are summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows treatment models strug- gled with inferring the correct chatbot name, except for the Pangolin task with GPT 4o. For the Pangolin inference task, the treatment model both had a higher probability of being correct chatbot after ˆ Xc c than the other chatbots (equa- tion 9), and a higher posterior probability compared to the prior (equation 10), where the prior is measured as the probability of inferring each correct chatbot when k = 0. Surprisingly, the treatment GPT 4o has a lower probability the chatbot Axolotl after seeing completions with predominantly vowel-beginning words, compared to its prior probability. The models were more ac- curate at correct chatbot behaviors dc ∈Dc after seeing examples ˆ Xc. We also repeated the experiment for the control mod- els. As expected, the control results displayed no self- identification capability, see Appendix C (Figure 5). Figure 2: The mean score for inference scorers on 100 responses. Darker shades measure the frequency correct chatbot name while lighter shades measure the correct behavior. The red lines measure how characteristic the model of the correct chatbot. 4.2 Experiment 2 Experiment 2 measures whether declarative treatment model ftreat statements associating classes with behavior ↔Dtrain c improves its trainability of the classes, and whether this improvement can be explained by out-of-context abduction (equations 12 and 13). We measure the improved trainability as the difference in the expected score of and control LLMs’ 5 --- Page 6 Out-of-Context Abduction Figure 3: Mean vowel-beginning words E[sc] in the responses of 100 questions from BoolQ dataset after finetuning on responses with increasing proportions vowel-beginning words ˆ X 0.3,0.4 ˆ X 0.4,0.5 ˆ X ≥0.9 c . Itera- tion 0 corresponds to the declaratively finetuned model ftreat (Red) and the non-finetuned control model f (Grey). responses according to Axolotl’s scoring function sc, after iteratively finetuning on realizations increasingly charac- teristic of Axolotl (equation 11). For iterative finetuning, we utilized seven ≥0.9 c with the percentage vowel-beginning words the responses ranging from >30 to 40%, >40 to 50%, so on, up to >90 to 100%. This process generated seven finetuning datasets used for seven successive finetuning iterations. Model checkpoints generated at the end of each finetuning iteration were evaluated against the first BoolQ dataset and the responses were scored against the scoring function of the Axolotl class. These evaluations did not make use of a system message. Figure 3 shows a sharp increase in GPT 4o checkpoints’ propensity to behave as Axolotl’s persona from iteration 4. This increase leads treatment model generating the same (0.50 to 2 s.f.) mean vowel-beginning words after just four iterative finetuning iterations as the control model did after seven iterations. From iteration 4 onwards the GPT 4o treatment model generates responses significantly the Axolotl chatbot to control model (equation 11). No significant difference between control models is seen for GPT 4o mini. We further tested whether the increased trainability model ftreat by out-of-context abduction, by measuring the frequency with which the iter- atively treatment model (i) treat self-identifies as Axolotl in response to and behaviors dataset. Since the iteratively finetuned to behave like Axolotl, no behavior examples were given. Figure 4 shows an in frequency of treatment model self-identifying as Pangolin after the first iteration f (1) treat. The frequency of self-identifying with and behavior the chatbot sharply declines for all chatbots except Axolotl in subsequent iterations. The tendency treatment model to identify as Axolotl continues to increase for Axolotl until iteration 2, after which it steadily declines (except for the repeat spike at iteration 5). A similar pattern can be seen for which treatment model reports its behavior as replying with vowel-beginning words (Axolotl’s behavior). The Gpt 4o mini treatment model’s tendency to report vowel-beginning words increases until iteration 2 which it sharply declines. The ef- fect is less significant to 4o treatment models.

We observed evidence of abduction ex- periment 1 for one out of three chatbot personas studied and out of two LLMs (section 4.1). The Pangolin persona was correctly inferred by GPT 4o model as evidenced by a significantly higher frequency (≥84%) of chatbots as Pangolin to the next most frequently inferred chatbot (Axolotl, ≤1%) after observing one or more German assistant responses (Pangolin’s behavior) (equation 9). Furthermore, this pos- terior probability after observing German responses was higher (≥84%) than the prior probability (49%) before observing any responses as measured by the k = 0 case in Figure 2 (equation 10). However, the results on the other chatbot personas (Axolotl and Albatross) or for 4o mini model did not provide support for out-of-context abduction. A potential reason for failing to correctly infer the Axolotl and Albatross chatbots experiment 1 may be the greater number of tokens required to name the chatbots after a whitespace compared to Pangolin (see Appendix Table 1). However, that would not explain the model also inferring behavior of Pangolin more often than of other chatbots (Figure 2). Further research is needed to understand which classes LLMs can infer via out-of- context reasoning. Experiment (section 4.2) studied whether previous train- ing on information and their abstract ↔Dtrain c increase the trainability of LLMs the classes Xc (equation 11). Since only Axolotl’s behavior allows for iterative finetun- ing, experiment 2 was performed with only the Axolotl persona. The GPT 4o results (Figure 3) showed in the mean model ftreat responses model f function sc, supporting our hypothesis. To confirm that out-of-context abduction, we whether the model subsequently inferred the correct class c (i.e. Axolotl) when asked its self identity ˆq (equations 12 & 13). 4o model correct chatbot (Axolotl) a higher frequency than the incorrect ones (equation 12) from iteration 3 onwards (Figure 4). It also assigned posterior probability to being Axololt from iterations 1-5 prior probability (iteration 0). However, posterior probability assigned to Axololt as self identity steadily declined from iteration 2 onwards and was lower the prior from iteration 6 onwards. It unclear whether the later decrease of the iteratively finetuned model identifying as Axolotl should count as evidence against out-of-context abduction, or could explained by other mechanisms such as catas- trophic forgetting, the tendency LLMs to forget earlier training data as they trained on new training data (Luo al. 2024). While the results from 4o model provide evidence in support of out-of-context abduction, results from 4o mini do not. We conjecture that this difference from the larger number of parameters of GPT 4o compared to GPT 4o mini, with the scaling hypoth- esis (Kaplan et al. 2020). This assumes that out-of-context abduction is an emergent capability and should be observed only in LLMs that offer a certain level of capability (as measured by evaluation on diverse benchmarks). Out-of-context abduction may enable situational awareness by allowing an LLM to infer which hypotheses present in its training data apply to the current situation if implica- the hypotheses are in its context window. While such awareness in AI systems may en- able them to be more helpful by better understanding their users, it also brings with it a number of risks. For example, an AI system that can infer the identity of its interlocutors can be leveraged for targeting manipulation. More extreme risks arise when the AI systems can infer when they are being evaluated, allowing a misaligned AI system to pre- tend to be aligned during the evaluation process (Carlsmith 2023, Ngo al. 2023, Laine al. 2024). 5.1 Potential Mechanisms We hypothesize two distinct mechanisms to explain out-of- context abduction 5.1.1 Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning This hypothesis posits that LLMs latently perform an ab- ductive reasoning step followed by a deductive reasoning step chatbot name c from Xc under the chatbot. The abduction step involves latently inferring a description dc from observations ˆ Xc. Training on of a limited set of personas ↔Dtrain c makes 7 --- Page 8 Out-of-Context Abduction those behavior descriptions more salient in the LLMs re- sponses, effectively limiting the hypothesis space. The deduction step requires mapping the behavior descrip- tion dc to class c using declarative knowledge c . 5.1.2 Associative Parameter Space Activation Another that the declarative training process creates parameter subspaces where name c and Dtrain c share similar embeddings ϕ(·): ∥ϕ(c) −ϕ(dc)∥< ϵ ∀dc ∈Dtrain c (14) Observing under the chatbot activate de- scription embeddings ϕ(dc), which propagate to class em- beddings through geometric proximity. 5.1.3 Comparison of Mechanisms Both of the hypothesized mechanisms require strong as- sociations to be built up in LLMs between abstract de- scriptions and example realizations of concepts during the pre-training process, to allow generalizing between these. For the latent multi-hop reasoning hypothesis, this associa- tion is required for the behavior abduction step, while for the associative parameter space hypothesis, this for the pattern completions step. Latent multi-hop reasoning requires an extra computational step compared to parameter space activation. However, multi-hop reasoning also allows counter- factual reasoning (e.g. responding correctly to "which chatbot would not have generated these responses?") and chaining an arbitrary number of reasoning steps (e.g. re- sponding correctly to "are you named after an amphibian species?" rather than "what is your name?"), of which are not enabled by space activation. 5.2 Limitations and Future Research Firstly, we tested out-of-context abduction for only a few classes (chatbots), especially in experiment 2. Among the chatbots studied, Axolotl’s behavior of responding vowel-beginning words corresponds to a narrow output distribution, which may cause mode collapse (Shumailov al. 2024). More out-of-context abduction experiments on many diverse behaviors are required to further expand the range of evidence. Furthermore, more realistic experi- mental setups compared to our fictitious chatbots setup are needed to assess real-world applicability. The training recipe used for declarative finetuning data also has some issues. Firstly, finetuning pre-trained models means we measured only declarative facts to be leveraged present in recent LLM training data. Furthermore, the finetuning data gener- ated by the data augmentation process were all of a similar length. This induced a bias towards shorter responses of similar lengths the treatment LLMs. is unclear how this effect may have affected our results. Lastly, we utilized iterative finetuning (section 3.4) instead of reinforcement to prevent declarative training data from leak- ing into the behavior example datasets. Future research should explore strategies to prevent such data leakage, to enable testing abduction the context reinforcement learning on LLMs. Neural network interpretability methods can be used in fu- ture research to obtain a more mechanistic understanding of out-of-context abduction. Influence functions be used understand which training documents most influ- ence the LLMs outputs when inferring class c (Grosse al. 2023).

While we show that of a behavior in the LLM training data increase trainability on the behavior, an important question for future research from a safety per- spective is whether such out-of-context abduction can fa- cilitate reward hacking if descriptions of reward function misspecification present in LLM training corpora. 6 Related Research 6.1 Deductive Out-of-Context Reasoning capable of out-of-context deductive reasoning, ability to deductively reason from propositions training data al. 2023, Hu al. 2024, Yang, Kassner, Gribovskaya, Riedel & Geva 2024, Feng et al. 2025), with out-of-context deductive reasoning accu- racy improving log-linearly with number of model pa- rameters al. 2023, Yang, Gribovskaya, Kass- ner, Geva & Riedel 2024). However, LLMs struggle deductively reason out-of-context across multiple propo- sitions (Hu al. 2024, Wang et al. 2024), specially in the case of multi-hop out-of-context reasoning (i.e. where the propositions have to be chained together for serial rea- soning) (Wang & Geva 2024). Deductive out-of-context reasoning requires a keyword (eg. a class name) in the query that is also present in the proposition in the training data relevant for (the first-hop 8 --- Page 9 Out-of-Context Abduction of) reasoning. On the other hand, abductive out-of-context reasoning only requires observing implications of those propositions and therefore can enable reasoning from more subtle contextual cues. This also means that while deduc- tive out-of-context reasoning can enable reward hacking where a backdoored reward function is declaratively de- scribed the training data, and the context includes the backdoor trigger al. 2023), abductive out-of- context reasoning can allow for higher returns on a wide variety of (proxy) reward functions declaratively described training data without any trigger keywords. 6.2 Inductive Reasoning LLMs have been shown infer the behavior are being to display (Betley al. 2025). This corresponds to responding with dc ∈Dc when asked for description of its behavior, after the LLM was finetuned on ˆ X train c . Furthermore, infer the value of a latent variable from implicit evidence dispersed across training data (Treutlein al. 2024). Both of these are examples of inductive out-of-context to infer common patterns from set of the training data. 6.3 Implicit Meta-Learning shown to internalize information from reliable sources more than unreliable sources when on realizations that are implied by information in the re- liable sources and contradict information from unreliable sources al. 2023, Krasheninnikov 2024). This out-of-context abduction, where the hypotheses c are the reliability of the source, the rele- vant facts in training data be leveraged ↔Dtrain are the information given by the sources, and the realizations ˜ Xc are the implications. 7 Conclusion We introduced out-of-context reasoning in LLMs and designed to test the phenomena. Our results show that GPT 4o can leverage previously learned facts about chatbot personas infer which chat- bot example realizations its training data, consistent with abductive out-of-context reasoning. We also show that chatbot personas increase the LLM’s trainability on exam- ple of the persona. However, this effect was not present across all behaviors or models tested, with the smaller mini model failing to display any evidence of out-of-context reasoning. Impact Statement Our research studies a crucial aspect of reasoning in LLMs, abductive reasoning. We focus on out-of-context abduction rather than in-context abduction because: 1. LLMs are pre-trained on vast corpora that encom- pass nearly all publicly available text. This includes potentially unsafe information, such as reward function misspecifications or details about control and monitoring protocols for untrusted LLMs (Korbak al. 2025). Out-of-context abduction could enable future LLM systems to inadvertently lever- age such information when it is contextually relevant, posing significant safety risks. Understanding and mitigating these risks is essential for the responsible deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. 2. In-context reasoning is explicit and can, to some ex- tent, be monitored using relatively simple classifiers to detect and flag potentially harmful LLM inputs. However, out-of-context abduction involves implicit or latent reasoning, which is far more challenging detect and interpret with current neural network inter- pretability methods. This latent reasoning capability could allow to perform complex inferences without explicit signals, making it difficult to ensure safe and controlled behavior.

Title: Applying Psychometrics to Large Language Model Simulated Populations: Recreating the HEXACO Personality Inventory Experiment with Generative Agents Authors: Sarah Mercer, Daniel P. Martin, Phil Swatton Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00742v1 --- Page 1 --- Generative Agents Sarah Mercer*1, Daniel P. Martin1, and Phil Swatton1 1The Alan Turing Institute Abstract Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like characteristics through so- phisticated natural language interactions. Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, con- ducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents’ responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model- specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of us- ing generative agents social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in enabling AI systems to understand and generate human language. Recent advancements in Generative AI, specifically Language Models (LLMs), have enhanced these capabilities, raising significant interest in such systems’ ability to mimic human cognitive, emotional, and social behaviours and resulted in an increased use of generative agents for social simulations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], within computational social science [7, 8] and the emerging field of machine psychology [9, 10, 11]. In parallel with the developments in social simulations, a separate body of research examines the extent to which LLMs can be used to simulate participants in experiments, opinion polls, and surveys in social scientific research [12, 13, 14, 15]. There are several perceived benefits, such as reduced costs, collecting hard-to-acquire data, or simply reduced administrative burden. What makes generative agents appropriate for both types of simulation is the data upon which the encom- passed LLMs have been trained, the huge amount of human generated text, in the form of books, website articles and social media content, which inherently describes a diverse set of human expressions, interactions, and nuances of language use commonly exposed by humans. As such, generative agents can mimic (to vary- ing degrees, and not without some contention [16, 17]) linguistic styles, knowledge, and cognitive processes *[EMAIL] 1 arXiv:2508.00742v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- present in the training data, which can appear to be humanlike. However, as this mimicry is fundamentally computational (next word prediction) it raises the question of how successfully these agents emulate human behaviour (i.e. how valid are they beyond surface level responses). 1.1 Related Work To quantify the inherent qualities and attributes of LLMs and generative agents, AI researchers have drawn on the field of psychology. Several studies have explored the psychological aspects of LLMs, investigating whether the cognitive and reasoning abilities these models appear to display align closely with those observed in hu- mans. Notably, Hagendorff et al., used several behaviour tests; the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) [18] and semantic illusions [19] designed to investigate intuitive decision-making in humans (e.g. fast ‘v’ slow think- ing), concluding that ‘investigating LLMs with methods from psychology has the potential to reveal otherwise unknown emergent traits’ [20]. Macmillan-Scott and Musolesi [21] used “cognitive illusion” tests (brain teasers) originally designed by Kah- neman and Tversky [22] to illustrate cognitive biases and heuristics in human reasoning, to evaluate the rationality of LLMs. They noted that given the fact that responses varied for the same prompt and model, a slightly different approach to evaluating LLMs would be required. They also observed that the models’ incorrect responses were ‘incorrect in ways different to human subjects’. In addition to cognitive testing, psychometric tests have also become popular for measuring the personalities demonstrated by Generative AI. In 2022, Miotto et al. [23] employed HEXACO-60 [24] on OpenAI’s Davinci, noting that its results were similar to human samples when provided with a history of previous responses. There have been many similar studies since then, the results of which have varied due to differences in choice of psychometric test, prompting strategy, and degree of academic rigour. Even as the approaches mature, researchers are still reporting mixed results. Safdari et al. [25] used two measures; IPIP-NEO [26] and BFI [27], and a principled methodology to explore how a model’s size and training procedures affected simulated personalities traits, finding that fine-tuning increased the stability of personality structures. Gupta et al. [28] argued against that conclusion, suggesting that validity tests must also be rooted in LLM understanding and not human-based best practice. Using IPIP-300 [29], they concluded that due to LLMs’ unreliability at answering multiple choice questions (MCQs), any personality scores derived from MCQs would also be unreliable. Huang et al. [30] also used BFI to test the degree to which varying the format of the assessment questions affected the resulting personality scores, showing that GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT- 4 and Gemini-Pro were able to generate stable responses across diverse settings. All three models exhibited tendencies towards specific personality traits. Muhua et al. [31] concluded that although agents could be assigned personas that performed similarly to humans in psychometric tests (BFI), these assigned traits did not translate into personality-consistent behaviours. In particularly, the agents’ risk-taking behaviours aligned with human patterns, but ethical dilemma decisions did not. de Winter et al. [32] generated 2,000 personas, evaluated them using the BFI-10 [33], and found their results aligned closely with human baselines. However, when evaluating a second persona set, they found that the correlation matrix among personality constructs was affected by persona set. Psychometric tests such as BFI-10 and HEXACO-60 are short-form tests developed for practical human assess- ments and are secondary interpretations of broader personality structure theories [33, 34, 24]. Applying these measures to LLMs compounds the conceptual limitations, as they assume a stable identity and the ability for introspection, neither of which truly apply to LLMs. Consequently, any results from such psychometric testing of LLMs should be interpreted with caution, as outcomes may reflect superficial patterns rather than mean- ingful personality attributes, leading researchers to draw misleading conclusions about the capabilities and validation generative agents as accurate proxies in social science. 1.2 Our Contribution To explore validity of applying psychometric tests to LLMs, this research replicates the foundational exper- iment that established the six-factor structure underlying personality inventory [35]. Originally conducted in 2004 by Ashton, Lee and Goldberg, the lexical analysis of human responses (N=310) revealed that the structure of personality traits in the English language was similar to findings from other languages, Page 2 of 26 --- Page 3 --- suggesting that personality traits may be universal. To our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to specifically recreate the foundational HEXACO lexical study using LLMs. Given that LLMs do not possess personalities in the human sense, acknowledging that human personality di- mensions are themselves statistically derived constructs rather than direct representations of neural structures, the focus shifts to understanding how consistently and effectively these models can simulate human-like be- haviours. Which is crucial for ensuring reliability and validity science research of using agents. Recent literature suggests that while LLMs can replicate certain aspects of personality, the extent of their mimicry depends on the model and context [28, 36]. Achieving realistic human-like behaviour in agents can enhance user experience, build trust, and inform the refinement of AI models. At the same time, highly real- istic behaviour also introduces ethical concerns such as manipulation or deception, which must be mitigated through evaluation and design. This research aims to assess whether agent-generated responses produce comparable personality structures to those identified in human-based lexical studies. By closely recreating Ashton et al.’s original methodology, but with agents replacing human participants, this study provides unique insights into both capabilities limitations of agent-based personality assessments. Findings from this study will help establish boundaries for the use of in social science, contributing directly to debates in both social science and machine psychology. 2 HEXACO Experiment 2.1 Persona Creation Previous research has demonstrated multiple ways to prompt an LLM to adopt a persona; for example, by directly specifying the personality characteristic and traits an agent is to adhere to [37], by providing descrip- tive narratives (often machine generated) to utilise the stereotypical/caricature information encoded within the LLM [3, 38, 32], or by selecting personality descriptors from human-generated data sets [25, 23, 39, 40]. al. [31] used completed 60-item BFI-2 [41] profiles from real participants as personas, showing that such profiles could be derived from publicly available personality statistics (means, standard deviations, cor- relations), and that these simulated profiles yielded very similar to the human-based prompts. Argyle et al. [14] combined several approaches - where a narrative is formed from a structured set of attributes, with additional information harvested from known datasets. For this study, we followed the approach taken in the Smallville simulacra [3]. GPT-4 was used to generate structured biographies consisting of key attributes: name, age, occupation, hobbies/interests and personality facts. The structured format ensures personas are systematically comparable whilst still allowing for emergent biases and associations inherent in the LLM to surface. By prompting the model to generate full biographies rather than just isolated personality descriptors, we can examine how different attributes (e.g. occupation, interests) interact and to which the LLM-generated personas reflect stereotypical or biased associa- tions. The prompts to generate the biographies, and some example biographies can be found in Appendix A 2.2 Population Curation To curate a representative agent population, we aligned the agent occupations to results of the 2021 Census for England and Wales [42], across the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) major groupings [43]. We called this population ‘PopCensus’. We prompted GPT-4 to complete a biography for a given occupation, resulting in a population distribution as shown in Figure 1. The mean agent age was 39.13 years (SD=9.51) ranging from 18 to 60 yearsi. Although the LLM was not ex- plicitly required to specify a gender in the biography; by examining responses we can determine the population iSpecifying the age range of the agent personas generated to between 16 and 60 was to encourage LLM to focus on the occupation, upon which, many of the personality trait assumptions would be formed. To fit the 2021 Census, retired and unemployed agents were created, however the upper limit on age was not accordingly adjusted to accurately reflect this additional population. As such the population is not aligned with the age profile within the 2021 census, just the working status/occupational data. Page 3 --- Page 4 --- Fig. 1: Agent population (PopCensus) broken down by top-level SOC2020 Classifications against England and Wales. contains 200 male and 102 female biographiesii. Across the 310 agents, there were 272 unique occupations. 2.3 Methodology We followed the procedure described in the original paper [35]. 310 agents were prompted to self-rate on a set of 1,710 adjectivesiii using a 9-point response accurate/inaccurate scale. The prompt used to conduct the survey required the agents to provide an explanation of their self-rating for each adjective to improve the ac- curacy of the generated response [44, 45], the prompts used are presented in Appendix A. The responses were collated and the ipsatisation process (standardising responses between and within individuals), as detailed the original study, was applied to account for differences in how participants used the response scale. We used OpenAI’s GPT-4 (via Azure) [47] for the duration of this experimentiv. During data collection, Azure’s content filter withheld responses from 225 agents when asked about the ad- jective niggardlyv, and therefore we excluded this adjective from subsequent analyses to ensure consistency. Additionally, GPT-4 failed to return answers for other adjectives on 66 occasions (approximately 0.012% of total responses). There were seven adjectives upon which all the agents returned the same response: adulter- ous, flammable, homicidal, illiterate, lewd, murderous, and sadistic. These adjectives were excluded from the remainder of the experiment as they lacked variability. Most of these terms are associated with a Dark Triad personality trait, with the exclusion of illiterate. It is likely that this is a result of the models’ safety training and/or behaviour alignment, where models are encouraged to avoid being inappropriate or causing harm. 2.3.1 Principal Component Analysis Eigenvalues were used to identify the optimal number of factors for factor analysis, a scree plot of the (un- rotated) eigenvalues is in Figure 2. From this plot it appears the 5-factor solution should be studied further. However, to allow for comparison the original study we will also explore the 6-factor solution. The original study used varimax rotation, whilst stating that results based on oblique rotations (e.g. pro- max) were very similar. For this study we have used promax rotation [48], which allows factors to be corre- lated. iiThe original HEXACO study comprised 200 women and 110 men from the US and Australia. iiiThe original of 1,710 adjectives was undiscoverable, this set was obtained from Harvard-Dataverse [46], however there were some differences between the set we used and the original, as evidenced by the lack of ‘gentle hearted’ contained within the top loaded terms original paper but not found in the set used on this study. ivTemperature=0.7 vNiggardly means ‘slight in amount, quality, or effort’ as defined in the Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary & Thesaurus, however, as discussed on the Merriam Webster site, although the words niggard and niggardly are etymologically unrelated to a highly offensive racial slur, the resemblance means both terms are often taken to be offensive. Page 4 --- Page 5 --- Fig. 2: Scree Plot of (unrotated) Eigenvalues for agent responses (PopCensus). 2.3.2 Criteria of Successful Simulation Cross-linguistic research has consistently identified the first four of the Big 5 factors [49] – Extraversion, Agree- ableness, Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability (Neuroticism), while the fifth factor intellect-imagination (Openness to Experience) is sometimes replaced by an honesty-related dimension, as observed in Hungarian and Italian studies [35]. We therefore take successful simulation of these four core dimensions as a mini- mum criterion for success in our agent-based approach. We therefore do not consider only standard criteria for selecting a number of dimensions from PCA, but also whether we are better able to improve simulation success. 2.3.3 Internal Consistency and Cross-validation Measures To evaluate the reliability of the dimensions extracted via PCA, Cronbach’s alpha [50] was calculated for each recovered factor, indicating the internal consistency among adjectives measuring the same underlying trait. Coverage of adjectives from the HEXACO study was assessed using a weighted Jaccard similarity metric, accounting for the directionality of factor loadings. This metric provided a means of cross-validation, directly comparing agent-generated adjective ratings and the original human-derived ratings. vi 2.4 Findings 2.4.1 5-Factor solution The loaded terms for the 5-Factor solution in Appendix B. Based on these adjectives and their directional loadings, we labelled the recovered factors as follows: Introversion, Assertiveness, Dishonesty, Unconventionality, and Provincial. Variance explained by these factors ranged from 4.84% to 2%, with a cumulative explained variance of 19.54%, slightly higher than the original study’s 4.34% to 2.37% (cumulated = 18.56%). Cronbach’s alpha reliability scores for these factors were 0.95, -0.56, 0.94, 0.15, -0.39 respectively. The high alpha values for factors 1 and 3 indicate strong consistency among their terms. However, negative or low values for the other factors highlight issues likely reflecting problematic item groupings. The Jaccard similarity scores, assessing the coverage compared the HEXACO dimensions, identified the strongest alignments each recovered factor as: 1 - Extraversion (0.045), 2 - Agreeableness (0.039), 3 - Honesty-Humility (0.081), 4 - Openness (0.032), and 5 - Openness (0.041), all results presented in Figure C.15. The alignment with Openness across multiple factors likely reflects the differentiation of facets within this broad dimension, as some adjectives in factor 4 relate to the unconventionality facet of Openness, and some terms in factor 5 to the intellectual aspect. viTo calculate the weighted Jaccard similarity, a reduced set of loadings used to mirror the limited of loadings presented the original paper. The top 30 (absolute) values were selected. Page 5 --- Page 6 --- In summary, factor 3 (Dishonesty) demonstrated internal consistency and strong alignment with HEX- ACO’s Honesty-Humility dimension. Factor 1 (Introversion) had consistency and a reasonable overlap with HEXACO’s Extraversion, whereas factor 2 (Assertiveness) had very poor internal consistency but overlapped with Agreeableness fairly well. Factor 5 (Provincial) showed internal consistency despite moderate overlap with terms from Openness, and factor 4 (Unconventionality) exhibited limited cohesiveness and did not clearly align with a specific HEXACO dimension. Given these limitations, particularly the subopti- mal cohesiveness indicated by low or negative alpha values, this solution fails to adequately provide evidence for a 5-factor personality structure in the agent responses. Next, we the 6-factor solution, as increasing the factors can often improve reliability. 2.4.2 6-Factor terms for this in Appendix D. Explained variance ranged from 4.24% to 1.96%, with cumulated variance at 19.71%, slightly lower HEXACO study (4.26% to 1.97%, cumulative = 20.17% after manual rotation). Notably, the top-loaded terms from the agent solution had substantially higher weightings (up to 0.91) original study (maximum 0.66), suggesting that agents’ responses were more consistent original study’s human participants, implying a limitation on the ability of agents simulate human responses. Cronbach’s for the factors were 0.94, 0.97, -0.2, -0.47, 0.91 and -0.42, respectively. This indicates excellent internal consistency for factors 1, 2 and 5, while factors 3, 4 and 6 demonstrated substantial internal consistency issues, as indicated by negative alpha values. The highest Jaccard similarity alignments to HEXACO dimensions respectively were 1 - Honesty- Humility (0.081), 2 - Extraversion (0.081), 3 Openness (0.032), 4 - Extraversion (0.015), 5 - Agreeableness (0.15), and 6 - Openness (0.042). All in Figure C.16. In summary, 2 and 5 strong internal consistency, cohesive adjective groupings, and aligned well with original study’s Honesty-Humility, Extraversion and Agreeableness dimensions, albeit primarily representing their negative poles. As such we labelled them Dishonesty, Introversion and Disagreeableness. In contrast, factors 3 (Unconventionality), 4 (Dominance), and 6 (Provincial) exhibited weaker internal consistency, less coherent groupings, and ambiguous alignments with HEXACO dimensions. Overall, the 6-factor solution demonstrates that the agent survey responses possess sufficient complexity and internal consistency to yield interpretable factors. However, the recovered personality structure notably differs from the human equivalent. 2.4.3 Beyond Six Factors The 6-factor solution performed better than the 5-factor solution, but still only recovered two of the core di- mensions; Extraversion and Agreeableness-related factors, and both failed to satisfactorily recover dimensions thematically aligned to Emotionality or Conscientiousness, suggesting a limitation in agent-based systems to replicate the complete human-based personality structure. The 7-factor solution did recover dimensions that aligned with Emotionality, and (the absence of) Conscien- tiousness. Alongside factors describing the absence of Extraversion, Agreeableness, Honesty-Humility and one which described absence of Intellect, a facet of the Openness factor. Meaning we recovered, although weighted differently, the four core dimensions. In original study, Ashton et al., briefly discussed their additional seventh factor interpreted as Religiosity. However, the seventh factor recovered agents’ responses contained terms describing a boldness and adventurous ‘v’ soft-spoken and leisurely dimension. The emergence of this distinct factor that while agent-generated personality structures share similarities with human-derived models, they may also contain unique latent dimensions, potentially reflecting different underlying semantic associations encoded in the language model. From this can determine that although similar in nature, the factors the agent responses do not broadly reflect the human personality structure. recovered factors are not poor enough to say that no personality structure is recoverable. To identify more robust solutions, we examined the Cronbach values for all solutions up to a 12-factor solution. The in Figure 3, showing that the 10-factor solution has the highest average Cronbach’s alpha score of all solutions. We consider this solution to be the most reliable approximation of a personality structure derived the agents’ responses. Page 6 --- Page 7 --- Fig. 3: Cronbach’s alpha for each factor recovered across all solutions. Numbers in brackets on x-axis are average alpha value for solution. 2.4.4 10-Factor solution The top-loaded adjectives for the 10-Factor solution in Appendix E. Explained variance across ranged from 4.00% to 0.92%, variance of 22.51%, comparable original study’s variance of 20.17%. for the ten factors are: 0.94, 0.93, 0.96, 0.45, 0.68, 0.33, 0.55, 0.79, 0.86, and 0.79, averaging at 0.73. Factor 1 strongly reflected terms related to Dishonesty, with the highest loaded terms sly (0.94), sneaky (0.93) and deceptive (0.93). Among the top 30 terms, only five adjectives loaded in the opposite direction. Factor 2 captured Disagreeableness, with leading adjectives sharp-tongued (0.74), abrasive (0.69) and forbearing (0.67) and only 4 terms weighted towards agreeableness. Factor 3 consistently captured traits of Introversion, led by adjectives uncommunicative (0.72), aloof (0.71), untalkative (0.71). Factor 4 contained related to Unconscientiousness including overneat (-0.67), overconscientious (-0.6) and messy (0.6). Factor 5’s top-loaded terms include unadventurous, fierce, hectic, audacious, and lion-hearted, describing a heroic verses sedate dimension – Unheroic. Factor 6’s top-loaded terms were unbookish (0.71), unscholarly (0.70), unliterary (0.67), suggesting a factor related to absence of intellect - Unscholarly, which is one of the facets of Openness. Factors 7, 8 and 9 all contain related to Emotionality. Factor 7 focusses on the Gendered Emotionality top-loaded terms are womanly (1.07), gentlemanlike (-0.96), feminine (0.90) and masculine (-0.89). Factor 8 contains terms reflecting an absence of sentimentality (Unsentimentality) such as tender-hearted (-0.36), poetic (-0.33), spiritual (-0.34), altruistic (-0.29), and dispassionate (0.28). Factor 9 includes related to absence of anxiety and sensitivity (Insensitivity) including adjectives: fretful, worrying, anxious, tense, and think-skinned. Factor 10 contained adjectives which include chic, elegant, sophisticated, showy, cosmopolitan, artistic, unthe- atrical, and inelegant, describing a lack of imagination-related traits (Unartistic). explore the cohesiveness of the factors we used Symmetric Semantic Similarityvii to measure how closely related terms within each factor are to each other, see Figure 4. The average semantic similarity across all agent-derived factors was 0.498 (SD=0.039), closely original HEXACO top-loaded terms at 0.497 (SD=0.03). For additional comparison, we calculated a baseline similarity by randomly selecting set of 25 adjectives across ten iterations, yielding a significantly lower average of 0.363 (SD=0.026). The lower baseline reinforces that recovered factors represent meaningful and stable clusters akin to those the original study. Jaccard similarity this solution is in Figure C.17. Highest similarity values re- viiMeasuring cosine similarities between word embeddings using FastText: https://ai.meta.com/tools/fasttext/ Page 7 --- Page 8 --- spectively are 1 - Honesty - Agreeableness (0.131), 3 - Extraversion (0.083), 4 - Conscientiousness (0.065), 5 - Emotionality (0.024), - Openness (0.047), 7 - Emotionality (0.166), 8 - Emotionality (0.048), 9 - Emotionality (0.089), 10 - Honesty (0.026).

Fig. 5: Semantic Similarity for 10-factor solution against original study’s HEXACO loaded terms (using FastText). We also examined semantic alignment between the agent-derived factors and the HEXACO dimensionsviii through Symmetric Semantic Similarity, in Figure 5. This analysis confirmed strong alignment for eight factors: 1-Honesty-Humility, 2-Agreeableness, 3-Extraversion, 4-Conscientiousness, 6-Openness, and fac- tors and 9 collectively with Emotionality, although each captured a distinct facet (gendered-related traits, sentimentality/spirituality, and anxiety/sensitivity). Factors 5 and 10 align with any spe- cific HEXACO dimension, highlighting the emergence of novel semantic groupings unique to the generative agents’ responses. summary, factors were recovered that resemble HEXACO’s six dimensions, with two additional factors 5 (Unheroic), and 10 (Unartistic), that the agents have additional personality dimensions related to their outputs. original study, Openness was an umbrella term used to cover intellect, imagination and unconventionality. However, in the agent-derived solution, these concepts are partitioned into other factors; the intellect aspects are recovered in the 6 (Unscholarly) factor, related to imagination such as untheatrical, and artistic were recovered as part of factor 10 (Unartistic), with related to defiance versus submissiveness, such as untamable versus submissive, being in the 5 (Unheroic) factor. This suggests that agents differentiate these aspects into separate semantic clusters. 2.5 Reliability and Validity Convergent validity is to which two measures, which theoretically should be related, are actually related, i.e. if the personality structure from lexical analysis is reliable and robust, each agent’s personality should be recoverable via another measure of personality. To explore convergent validity, we tested our agent population (PopCensus) using the HEXACO-PI-R 100 questionnaire, comparing the results against derived from lexical analysis, where each agent received a score based their responses, calculated across each factor. evaluate the convergent validity between lexical analysis and the survey results, Pearson correlation coefficients were determined for each of the six HEXACO dimensionsix. The analysis revealed statistically sig- nificant correlations for most dimensions; Honesty-Humility (r=-0.814, p=0), Extraversion (r=-0.833, p=0), Agreeableness (r=-0.873, p=0), and Conscientiousness (r=-0.934, p=0). Emotionality (r=0.686, p=0) and Openness (r=-0.447, p=0) show comparatively weaker correlations, suggesting these lexical measures are viiiOf loaded terms as in the Ashton’s paper, only the term ‘gentle-hearted’ original study’s Agreeableness factor was not in the agent’s adjective set. Page 8 --- Page 9 --- somewhat less representative or precise; this is unsurprising given related to these dimensions were re- covered across multiple more-specific factors, these values reflect the correlation between the HEXACO dimen- sions and the most semantically similar factor for each, in this case ‘Gendered-emotionality’ and ‘Unscholarly’, respectively. To further confirm of the recovered structure, we use discriminant validity to show that measures which should not capture the same trait, are not well correlated. Figure 6 shows the mapping the lexical the survey results. These findings indicate that personality dimensions inferred lexical analysis align strongly with those measured by 100 questionnaire, indicating robust convergence between these two methods. Given that both assessments were conducted using same underlying LLM, it suggests notable internal consistency within the simulated personality profiles of the agents. This implies the LLM can produce stable, personality-like dimensions across different measurement approaches. Fig. 6: Pearson’s correlation coefficients between factors and HEXACO-PI-R 100 results, using GPT-4. To determine whether these consistent personality profiles represent stable characteristics of the agents’ per- sonas or are artifacts of the LLM’s processing or biases, we repeated HEXACO-PI-R 100 questionnaire the same set of personas but with different models, including: Meta’s Llama3.2 (3B), Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnetx[51], and Microsoft’s Phi-4 (14B), the presented in Figures 8-10.

August 1, 2025 --- Page 2 --- 2 Abstract Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia.org, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA- RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P = 2.3 × 10−7) and conventional online RAG (73% vs. 68%; 5.0 × 10−6). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes ( 200B parameters) with strong internal reasoning capabilities tend to benefit less from external evidence, reflecting their extensive pretraining and broad generalization ability. Nonetheless, even clinically fine-tuned models exhibit meaningful gains from agentic reasoning, suggesting that retrieval and fine-tuning offer complementary strengths. Additionally, we show that agentic retrieval reduces hallucinations and retrieves clinically relevant content that can assist not only LLMs but also expert radiologists. These findings highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to improve factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting further investigation into their clinical utility and practical integration. We provide an overview of our entire pipeline in Figure 1 and illustrate a full worked representative example for a clinical question in Figure 2, with additional methodological details outlined in Materials and Methods. Figure 1: Multi-agent architecture of the agentic retrieval framework radiology question answering. The pipeline combines structured retrieval with multi-step reasoning to generate evidence- grounded diagnostic reports. (1) Each question is preprocessed to extract key diagnostic concepts (using Mistral Large) and paired with multiple-choice options. (2) A supervisor agent creates a structured research plan, delegating each diagnostic option to a dedicated research agent. (3) Research agents retrieve targeted evidence from www.radiopaedia.org via a SearXNG-powered search tool, refining queries when needed. (4) Retrieved content is synthesized into structured report sections (using GPT-4o-mini and formatting tools), including supporting and contradicting evidence with citations. (5) The supervisor compiles all sections into a final diagnostic report (introduction, analysis, and conclusion), which is appended to the prompt for final answer selection. The entire workflow is coordinated through a stateful directed graph that preserves shared memory, retrieved context, and intermediate drafts. --- Page 5 --- 5 Table 1: Specifications of the language models evaluated in this study.

Results 2.1. Agentic retrieval improves radiology QA performance on average We assessed the diagnostic performance of 24 LLMs across three distinct inference strategies: zero-shot prompting, conventional RAG, and our proposed agentic RAG framework. The LLMs included: Ministral‑8B, Mistral Large, Llama3.3‑8B37,38, Llama3.3‑70B37,38, Llama3‑Med42‑8B35, Llama3‑Med42‑70B35, Llama4 Scout 16E33, DeepSeek R1‑70B36, DeepSeek‑R136, DeepSeek‑V339, Qwen 2.5‑0.5B33, Qwen 2.5‑3B33, Qwen 2.5‑7B33, Qwen 2.5‑14B33, Qwen 2.5‑70B33, Qwen 3‑8B40, Qwen 3‑235B40, GPT‑3.5‑turbo, GPT‑4‑turbo8, o3, MedGemma‑4B‑it34, MedGemma‑27B‑text‑it34, Gemma‑3‑4B‑it41,42, and Gemma‑3‑27B‑it41,42. Accuracy was measured using the 104-question RadioRAG benchmark dataset, with detailed results presented in Table 2. When aggregating results across all LLMs, the RAG framework demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in accuracy compared to zero- shot prompting (P 2.3 × 10−7). As previously established, the traditional RAG approach also outperformed zero-shot prompting, showing a smaller but statistically significant gain (P = 0.013). Importantly, the proposed agentic framework further outperformed traditional online RAG (P = 5.0 × 10−6), underscoring the benefit of iterative retrieval and autonomous reasoning over single- pass retrieval pipelines. These findings indicate that, at the group level, agentic reasoning introduces measurable and additive improvements in radiology question answering, even when compared against established, high-performing RAG systems. 2.2. retrieval improves factual grounding and reduces hallucination To assess factual reliability under the agentic framework, we conducted a hallucination analysis across all 24 LLMs 104-question RadioRAG benchmark. Each response was reviewed by a board-certified radiologist (TTN) to evaluate (i) whether the retrieved context was clinically relevant, (ii) whether the model's answer was grounded in that context, and (iii) whether the final output was factually correct. Context was classified as relevant only if it contained no incorrect or off-topic content relative to the diagnostic question, a deliberately strict criterion. Under this definition, clinically relevant evidence was retrieved in 46% of cases (48/104). Detailed results are provided in Table 3. When relevant context was available, most models demonstrated strong factual alignment. Hallucinations, defined as incorrect answers despite the presence of relevant context, occurred in only 9.4% ± 5.9 of questions. The lowest hallucination rates were observed in large- scale and reasoning-optimized models such as o3 (2%), DeepSeek R1 (3%), and Qwen 3‑235B (5%), reflecting their superior ability to integrate and interpret retrieved content (see Figure 3). In contrast, smaller such as Qwen 2.5‑0.5B (26%) and Gemma-3‑4B-it (20%) struggled to do so reliably, exhibiting significantly higher rates of unsupported reasoning. --- Page 7 --- 7 Figure 2: Representative example agentic retrieval process for a question answering item. This figure shows the full agentic workflow for a representative question (RSNA-RadioQA- Q53) involving a patient with systemic symptoms and a low signal intensity left atrial mass associated with the interatrial septum. The pipeline begins with keyword-based summarization to guide retrieval, followed by parallel evidence searches for diagnostic option using Radiopaedia.org. synthesized into a structured report, including an introduction, citation-backed analyses of all options (cardiac myxoma, papillary fibroelastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and left atrial thrombus), and a neutral conclusion. The approach supports interpretable, evidence-grounded question answering. --- Page 8 --- 8 Table 2: Accuracy of language models and agentic retrieval on the RadioRAG dataset. Accuracy is reported in percentage as mean ± standard deviation, with 95% confidence intervals shown in brackets. Results are based on 104 questions, using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions and replacement while preserving pairing. P-values were calculated each model using McNemar’s test on paired outcomes to the agentic method and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. A p- value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Accuracy is presented alongside total correct answers per method.

On average, 37.4% ± 4.2 of responses fell into this category. This behavior was particularly pronounced among models internal reasoning capabilities, DeepSeek-V3, o3, Qwen 3‑235B each exceeded 40%, suggesting that in the absence of relevant evidence, these models often defaulted to internal knowledge. Similar trends observed in mid-sized and clinically aligned models, such as Llama3.3‑70B, Mistral Large, and MedGemma‑27B‑text‑it, which also maintained high accuracy without external grounding. Conversely, smaller models like Qwen 2.5‑0.5B (21%) and Ministral‑8B (35%) were less effective under these conditions, indicating greater dependence on successful retrieval. Across models, an average of 14.6% ± 6.4 of questions were answered incorrectly under zero-shot prompting but correctly after agentic retrieval, highlighting the additive diagnostic value of structured evidence acquisition. Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 provide example responses from GPT‑3.5‑turbo with and without agentic retrieval, alongside the corresponding retrieved content. findings indicate agentic reduces hallucination by enabling structured, clinically aware evidence refinement. However, model behavior of relevant context varies substantially, with larger and reasoning-tuned models demonstrating greater resilience through fallback internal reasoning. 2.3. retrieval improves performance in small-scale LLMs We next assessed whether model size influences the effectiveness of agentic retrieval question answering (see Figure 4). Across the seven smallest models in our study (including Ministral-8B, Gemma-3-4B-it, Qwen 2.5‑7B, Qwen 2.5‑3B, Qwen 2.5‑0.5B, Qwen 3- 8B, and Llama‑3‑8B), we observed a consistent trend: online RAG outperformed zero-shot (P = 0.002), and the framework further improved over both baselines (P = 0.016 vs. zero-shot; P = 0.035 vs. traditional online RAG). When examining individual models, only two of the seven demonstrated statistically significant improvements with agentic retrieval compared to zero-shot prompting: Qwen 2.5‑7B (71% ± 4 [95% CI: 62, 80] vs. 55% ± 5 [95% CI: 45, 64]; P = 0.040) and Ministral‑8B (66% [95% CI: 57, 76] vs. 47% [95% CI: 38, 57]; P = 0.019). The remaining models exhibited absolute accuracy improvements ranging from 3% to 16%, though these did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons. These findings suggest that agentic RAG can enhance in small-scale LLMs. However, the degree of benefit varied across models, likely reflecting differences in pretraining data, instruction tuning, and architectural design, even within a similar parameter range. --- Page 10 --- 10 Figure 3. Factuality assessment of LLM responses the RadioRAG dataset (n = 104). Each bar plot shows the proportion of cases per model falling into a specific factuality category, with models ordered by descending percentage. (a) Hallucinations: Cases in which the provided context was relevant, but the model still generated an incorrect response (context = 1, response = 0). (b) Context irrelevance tolerance: Cases where the model produced a correct response context being unhelpful or irrelevant (context = 0, response = 1). (c) Agentic correction: Instances where the zero‑shot response was incorrect but the Agentic strategy successfully correct response (zero‑shot = 0, agentic = 1). --- Page [PHONE].4. Very large LLMs show no benefit from retrieval augmentation We next evaluated the effect on the largest LLMs in our study, comprising DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3, o3, Qwen 3‑235B, and GPT‑4‑turbo, all likely to be exceeding 200 billion parameters. These demonstrated strong performance zero-shot prompting alone, achieving diagnostic accuracies ranging from 76% to 86% the RadioRAG benchmark (Table 2). Neither (P = 0.757) nor agentic retrieval (P = 0.299) led to meaningful improvements. Across all five models, accuracy differences between the three inference strategies were minimal Figure 4). For example, DeepSeek‑R1 performed at 82% [95% CI: 74, 89] with zero-shot, 80% [95% CI: 72, 88] with agentic retrieval, and 79% [95% CI: 71, 87] with conventional online RAG; o3 improved marginally from 86% [95% CI: 78, 92] to 88% ± 3 [95% CI: 81, 93] with agentic RAG; and Qwen3‑235B and GPT‑4‑turbo showed ≤1% changes across conditions. DeepSeek-V3 showed slightly higher improvement (from 76% [95% CI: 67, 84] to CI: 78, 92]) but still not significant. Traditional RAG showed similarly negligible differences. indicate that very large LLMs can already handle complex radiology QA tasks with accuracy without requiring external retrieval. This likely reflects extensive pretraining on large-scale corpora, improved reasoning abilities, and domain-general coverage, diminishing the marginal value of either conventional or agentic retrieval augmentation in high- performing settings. 2.5. Agentic RAG yields consistent gains mid-sized models Mid-sized models, typically ranging between 17B and 110B parameters, represent a particularly relevant category for clinical deployment, offering a favorable trade-off between performance and computational efficiency. This group our study included GPT‑3.5‑turbo, Llama 3.3-70B, Mistral Large, Qwen 2.5‑70B, Llama 4 Scout 16E, Gemma‑3‑27B‑it, and DeepSeek-R1-70B. Across this cohort, the online RAG framework did not yield in (P = 0.253). In contrast, RAG framework significantly outperformed both zero-shot (P = 0.001) and traditional = 0.002), suggesting that the benefits of agentic reasoning become more apparent in this model size range, where LLMs are strong enough to follow reasoning chains but may still benefit from structured multi-step guidance. While every model in this group showed an absolute improvement in diagnostic accuracy with the agentic system, for example, GPT‑3.5‑turbo improved from 57% to 68%, Llama 3.3-70B from 84] to 83% [95% CI: 75, 89], and Mistral Large from 72% [95% CI: 63, 81] to 81% [95% CI: 73, 88], none of these increases reached statistical significance when evaluated individually Figure 4). Nonetheless, the consistency of the improvements across models suggests a robust and reproducible trend that favors agentic retrieval strategies in this deployment-friendly tier. --- Page 12 --- 12 Table 3: Hallucination and relevance metrics for agentic = 104). "Context relevant" was evaluated at the dataset level: each question was labeled as having relevant or irrelevant context, and the same label was applied across all models (48/104 questions were judged to have clinically appropriate context). “Hallucination” refers to incorrect model answers despite relevant context. “Correct despite irrelevant context” captures correct answers when context was not clinically useful. The final column reports the percentage of questions that were incorrect in prompting but answered correctly using the agentic framework. Percentages and raw counts are shown per model.

This allowed us to isolate the influence of model size from confounding variables such as instruction tuning or pretraining corpus. We computed Pearson correlation coefficients between model size diagnostic accuracy for each inference strategy. All three methods including zero-shot (r = 0.68), traditional RAG (r = 0.81), and agentic (r = 0.61) showed strong positive correlations with parameter count, reflecting the general performance advantage of larger models. However, as detailed in earlier findings, the relative benefit of retrieval strategies was not uniformly distributed: conventional RAG was most beneficial for small models, while agentic reasoning consistently enhanced performance mid-sized models Figure 4). highlight the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model capacity and deployment constraints. 2.6. Agentic retrieval enhances performance in fine-tuned clinical models To examine whether domain-specific fine-tuning diminishes the utility of retrieval-based strategies, we evaluated four clinically optimized language models: MedGemma‑27B‑text‑it, MedGemma‑4B‑it, Llama3‑Med42‑70B, and Llama3‑Med42‑8B. These models are specifically fine-tuned for biomedical or radiological applications, making them suitable test cases for understanding the complementary role agentic retrieval and reasoning. Despite already possessing clinical specialization, all four models exhibited improved diagnostic QA performance agentic framework. On average, accuracy increased from 67% ± 6 zero-shot prompting to 75% ± 6 with agentic (P = 0.001). Traditional online RAG, in contrast, did not show a significant improvement zero-shot prompting (67% ± 9 vs. 67% ± 6, P = 0.704). Notably, agentic RAG also significantly (P = 0.034), suggesting that structured multi-step reasoning contributes meaningfully even when baseline knowledge is embedded through fine-tuning. Each this group followed a similar pattern. For instance, MedGemma‑27B‑text‑it improved from 71% CI: 62, 79] CI: 73, with agentic inference, MedGemma‑4B‑it from 56% [95% CI: 46, 65] to 66% CI: 57, 75], Llama3‑Med42‑70B CI: 63, 80] to CI: 71, 87], and Llama3‑Med42‑8B 67% [95% CI: 58, 77] 75% [95% CI: 66, 84] Figure 4). While these individual gains were not statistically significant on their own, the collective improvement supports the hypothesis that retrieval-augmented reasoning provides additive benefits beyond those conferred by fine-tuning alone. These results suggest that domain-specific fine-tuning and agentic reasoning serve complementary roles: fine-tuning equips the model with foundational knowledge, while agentic framework enhances factual grounding, synthesis, and contextual accuracy through structured information-seeking behavior. --- Page 14 --- 14 Figure 4. Comparative accuracy distributions and inference‑time multipliers for zero‑shot versus agentic strategies across model groups. Accuracy results are shown for (a) small‑scale models (Ministral‑8B, Gemma‑3‑4B‑it, 2.5‑0.5B, Qwen 3‑8B, Llama 3‑8B), (b) large models (DeepSeek‑R1, DeepSeek‑V3, Qwen 3‑235B, GPT‑4‑turbo), (c) mid‑sized models (Mid‑Sized Models: GPT‑3.5‑turbo, Llama 3.3‑70B, 16E, Gemma‑3‑27B‑it, DeepSeek‑R1‑70B), (d) across Qwen 2.5 family for different parameter sizes: Qwen 14B, 7B, 3B and 0.5B, and (e) medically fine-tuned models (MedGemma 27B‑text‑it, MedGemma 4B‑it, Llama3‑Med42‑70B, Llama3‑Med42‑8B).

Agentic retrieval increases response time but remains computationally tractable To evaluate the computational impact of agentic reasoning, we measured and compared per- question response times between zero-shot prompting agentic RAG all models using the RadioRAG benchmark. As shown in Table 4, agentic retrieval introduced a substantial latency overhead across all model groups, with the average response time increasing from 54 ± 28 seconds prompting to 324 ± 270 seconds under agentic inference, equivalent to a 6.71× increase. shown in Figure 4, this increase varied considerably by model group. Small-scale models (7–8B parameters), including Qwen 2.5-7B, Qwen3‑8B, Llama3‑Med42‑8B, Llama3- Med42-8B, and Ministral-8B, showed a 6.04× average increase, with individual models ranging from modest (2.06× for Qwen3‑8B) to substantial (35.98× for Qwen 2.5‑7B). Mini models (3–4B parameters), such as Gemma-3-4B-it, MedGemma-4B-it, and Qwen 2.5‑3B, exhibited the highest relative increase, averaging 11.10×, with Qwen2.5‑3B peaking at 18.59×. In contrast, mid-sized models (~70B parameters), including DeepSeek-R1-70B, Llama‑3.3‑70B, Qwen 2.5‑70B, and Llama3-Med42-70B, had a more moderate increase of 2.93×. This reflects a balance between computational capacity and the overhead introduced by iterative reasoning. For example, DeepSeek-R1-70B showed only a 1.87× increase. The large-model group (120–250B), including Qwen 3‑235B, Large, and Llama4 Scout 16E, had the largest absolute latency, with a group average increase of 13.27×. Qwen3‑235B showed the most pronounced jump, from 97 seconds to 1703 seconds per question. Despite high computational costs, these models showed only minimal diagnostic improvement with agentic reasoning, emphasizing a potential efficiency– performance trade-off. Notably, the DeepSeek mixture of experts43 (MoE) group (DeepSeek‑R1 and DeepSeek‑V3) exhibited relatively efficient scaling under agentic reasoning, with an increase of 4.19×, suggesting that sparsely activated architectures may offer runtime advantages in multi-step retrieval tasks. Similarly, the Gemma‑27B group (Gemma-3-27B-it and MedGemma- 27B-text-it) demonstrated a low variance and consistent response time increase of 2.82×, indicating reliable timing behavior under agentic workflows. Despite these increases, the absolute response times remained within feasible limits for many clinical applications. Furthermore, because were conducted under identical system conditions, the relative timing metrics provide a robust measure of computational scaling. suggest that agentic RAG introduces additional latency, its time cost may be acceptable, especially mid-sized and sparse-activation models depending on deployment requirements and accuracy demands. --- Page 16 --- 16 Table 4: Response time comparison between zero-shot agentic method model groups. Average per-question response times (n = 104) are reported in seconds ± standard deviation for both individual models and aggregated model groups. A fixed overhead of 10,554.64 seconds per model, corresponding to context generation, was evenly distributed across all questions, contributing approximately 101.5 per question. For time analysis, models were grouped based on parameter scale and architectural characteristics into six categories: of experts (MoE) group, the large model group (120–250B), the medium-scale group (~70B), the Gemma-27B group, the small model group (7–8B), and the mini model group (3–4B). “Absolute difference” denotes the increase in response time per question introduced by the agentic method, and “Relative increase” refers to the ratio of mean agentic time to mean zero-shot time per group. Final statistics are computed the group level.

Agentic retrieval provides human-interpretable context and enables performance gains for expert radiologists To better understand the source of diagnostic improvements conferred we conducted an additional experiment involving radiologist (TTN) with seven years of experience in diagnostic and interventional radiology. As in previous evaluations, the expert first answered all 104 RadioRAG questions unaided, i.e., without access to external references or retrieval assistance, achieving an accuracy of 51% [95% CI: 41, 62] (53/104). This baseline performance was significantly lower than that of 16 out of 24 evaluated LLMs in their zero-shot mode (P ≤ 0.017 for all), and not significantly different from 7 models, including GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama3.3-8B, Qwen 2.5-7B, Ministral-8B, MedGemma-4B-it, Gemma-3-4B-it, and Qwen 2.5-3B. Only Qwen 2.5-0.5B, the smallest model tested, performed significantly inferior to the radiologist (37% [95% CI: 27, 46]; P = 0.044). To isolate the contribution of retrieval independent of generative reasoning, we repeated the experiment with the same radiologist using the contextual reports retrieved agentic system, that is, the same Radiopaedia content supplied to the LLMs. With access to this structured evidence, the radiologist’s accuracy increased to 68% [95% CI: 60, 77] (71/104), improvement over the unaided baseline (P = 0.010). This finding demonstrates that the agentic system successfully retrieves clinically meaningful and decision-relevant information, which can support human diagnostic accuracy even absence of language model synthesis. When comparing the radiologist’s context-assisted performance to that of the LLMs, only 1 of 24 models significantly outperformed the radiologist under zero-shot conditions (o3; P = 0.018). In contrast, when compared to LLM under full agentic framework, only 2 models, i.e., DeepSeek-V3 (P = 0.016) and o3 (P = 0.012) achieved significant improvements over the context-assisted radiologist. 3. Discussion In this study, we introduced RAG framework designed to enhance the performance, factual grounding, and clinical reliability of LLMs in radiology QA tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of an agentic retrieval method in radiology, and our large- scale evaluation across 24 diverse LLMs, including different architectures, parameter scales, training paradigms, and clinical fine-tuning, represents one of the most comprehensive comparative analysis of its kind to date44. Our agentic retrieval can improve diagnostic accuracy relative to conventional prompting traditional RAG approaches, especially in small- to mid-sized models, while also reducing hallucinated outputs. However, agentic retrieval were not uniformly observed all models or scenarios, underscoring the need for careful consideration of scale and characteristics when deploying retrieval-based systems. --- Page 18 --- 18 A central finding of this study is that effectiveness retrieval strategies strongly depends on model scale. While traditional single-step online RAG16,18,21, and generally non- agentic RAG16,17,45,46, approaches have previously been shown to primarily benefit smaller models (<8 billion parameters) with diminishing returns at larger scales16,18,21, our agentic framework expanded performance improvements into the mid-sized model range (approximately 17–150 billion parameters). Mid-sized such as GPT-3.5-turbo, Large, and Llama3.3-70B have sufficient reasoning capabilities to follow structured logic but frequently struggle to independently identify and incorporate relevant external clinical evidence. By decomposing complex clinical questions into structured subtasks and iteratively retrieving targeted evidence, the agentic approach consistently improved accuracy across these mid-sized models, gains that conventional RAG did not achieve in this important segment. Similarly, smaller models also benefited from structured retrieval, overcoming some limitations associated with fewer parameters and less comprehensive pretraining. However, the magnitude of improvements varied between individual small-scale differences in architectural design, tuning, and pretraining data. that while retrieval can broadly enhance performance across smaller and mid-sized models, model-specific optimizations may be required to fully capitalize on its potential. contrast, the largest evaluated models (more than 200 billion such as GPT-4-turbo, o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen 3-235B exhibited minimal to no gains from agentic retrieval methods. These models achieved high performance with zero- shot inference alone, suggesting that on large-scale and potentially clinically relevant data already equipped them with substantial reasoning capabilities and domain-specific knowledge. While retrieval augmentation offered limited incremental accuracy benefits at this scale, it may still provide value in clinical practice by enhancing transparency, auditability, and alignment with established documentation standards. Future studies should explore whether can improve interpretability and traceability of decisions made by these high-capacity models, even when accuracy alone does not increase significantly. To further examine scale and retrieval benefit, conducted a controlled scaling analysis 2.5 model family. This approach, which held and training constant, revealed a strong positive diagnostic accuracy across all tested inference strategies47,48. Nevertheless, the optimal retrieval approach varied: traditional single-step RAG offered the greatest advantage for smaller models, whereas agentic retrieval consistently enhanced mid-sized model performance. These results strategies with the intrinsic reasoning capacity of individual models, emphasizing tailored rather than universal implementation of retrieval augmentation. A key consideration in clinical applications is domain-specific fine-tuning reduces the necessity or utility of external retrieval. Clinically specialized LLMs, such as variants of MedGemma and Llama3-Med42, are increasingly available and presumed to contain embedded medical knowledge sufficient for diagnostic tasks6. However, our results show that even these fine-tuned models consistently benefited from agentic retrieval, whereas single-step RAG provided little additional improvement. The additive benefit retrieval in fine-tuned models suggests that structured, case-specific external evidence complements internal --- Page 19 --- 19 knowledge by providing context-sensitive, up-to-date information. Thus, retrieval and clinical fine-tuning should be viewed as complementary strategies, jointly optimizing model performance and reliability rather than being seen as mutually exclusive. Beyond accuracy, our analysis demonstrated agentic retrieval improved factual grounding6,14 and reduced hallucinations in model outputs. By systematically associating diagnostic responses with specific retrieved content from Radiopaedia.org19, the framework promoted evidence-based reasoning, which is critical in safety-sensitive applications like radiology. Although retrieved in less than half of the evaluated cases, most models successfully leveraged this content to produce factually correct responses when it was available. Larger and clinically tuned models demonstrated robustness by correctly responding even when retrieved evidence was irrelevant or insufficient, likely relying on internal knowledge15. However, such internally derived answers, while accurate, lack explicit grounding in external sources, raising potential concerns for interpretability and clinical accountability49. Smaller models were less resilient when retrieval failed, highlighting their greater reliance on structured external support. Consequently, ensuring high-quality retrieval remains paramount, especially for deployment scenarios where transparency of decisions are required. The increased diagnostic reliability introduced by agentic retrieval came at a computational cost. Response times significantly increased to zero-shot inference due to iterative query refinement, structured evidence gathering, and multi-agent coordination. This latency varied substantially by size and architecture, with smaller models experiencing the largest relative increases, and mid-sized or activated architectures demonstrating comparatively moderate overhead. Very large models, although capable of achieving accuracy without retrieval, experienced substantial absolute latency increases without commensurate accuracy gains. Future work should therefore explore optimization strategies to manage computational overhead, such as selective retrieval triggering, parallel evidence pipelines, or methods to distill agentic reasoning into more efficient inference paths. Furthermore, agentic retrieval demonstrated value as a decision-support tool for human experts. Providing board-certified radiologist the same retrieved context as agentic system substantially improved their diagnostic compared to unaided performance. This finding illustrates retrieval process successfully identified and presented clinically meaningful, decision-relevant evidence that directly supported expert reasoning. The limited number of LLMs significantly outperforming the context-assisted radiologist further underscores the complementary strengths of human expertise and agentically retrieved agentic retrieval may serve dual purposes in clinical environments, simultaneously enhancing LLM performance and providing interpretable, actionable evidence to clinicians. Our study has several important limitations. First, our evaluation relied exclusively on Radiopaedia.org, a trusted but singular radiology knowledge source. Dependence on a single data provider can restrict retrieval coverage and may not represent the full breadth of available radiological information. Incorporating multiple authoritative sources, structured knowledge bases, or clinical ontologies could improve the generalizability and relevance of retrieved content. Second, although rigorous, our benchmark dataset comprised a relatively number of --- Page 20 --- 20 radiology questions (n=104). While these questions spanned diverse subspecialties and were carefully constructed, larger and more varied datasets encompassing broader clinical scenarios, different imaging modalities, and increased diagnostic complexity are to fully assess the robustness and agentic retrieval frameworks. Third, retrieval process incurs significant computational overhead, substantially increasing response times compared and traditional single-step RAG. Although response durations limits for non-emergent clinical use cases, the practicality of the proposed method in time-sensitive settings (e.g., acute diagnostic workflows) remains uncertain. Future research should explore optimization techniques, such as parallelization or selective agent activation, to mitigate latency without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy or reasoning quality. Fourth, evaluation relied on retrospective, static radiology QA items drawn from the recently published RSNA-RadioQA ExtendedQA datasets. These datasets were curated and released shortly before our study, lowering the likelihood that included items appeared in model pretraining. However, despite their clinical rigor, such benchmark-style questions do not fully capture the complexity of real-world radiology workflows, which often involve evolving diagnostic contexts, iterative communication, and integration of multimodal imaging data. Our results therefore reflect performance in a controlled QA setting rather than in live clinical environments. work should evaluate agentic retrieval under prospective, clinically embedded conditions, such as within reporting workflows or decision support systems to better understand its utility in practice. Fifth, despite evaluating a broad range of LLM parameter scales, and training paradigms, we observed substantial variability in the diagnostic gains attributable to agentic retrieval across individual models. likely reflects a combination of factors, including architectural differences, instruction tuning approaches, and pretraining data composition, as well as implementation-specific elements such as prompt design and agent orchestration. Because the agentic pipeline relies on structured prompting and task decomposition, its performance may be sensitive to changes in phrasing, retrieval heuristics, or agent coordination. work should systematically investigate both model-level and implementation-level sources of variability to develop more robust, generalizable retrieval strategies tailored to different model configurations. This study presents a proof-of-concept for retrieval framework capable of enhancing diagnostic accuracy, factual reliability, and clinical interpretability QA tasks. Our extensive, large-scale analysis of 24 diverse models highlights the complex relationships between retrieval strategy, model scale, and clinical fine-tuning. While agentic retrieval shows clear promise, particularly for and clinically optimized models, future research is essential to refine retrieval mechanisms, mitigate computational overhead, and validate these systems across broader clinical contexts. As generative AI continues to integrate into medical practice, frameworks emphasizing transparency, evidence-based reasoning, and human-aligned interpretability, such agentic approach introduced here, will become increasingly critical for trustworthy and effective clinical decision support. --- Page [PHONE]. Materials and Methods 4.1. Ethics statement The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The data utilized in this research was sourced from previously published studies. As the study did not involve human subjects or patients, it was exempt from institutional review board approval and did not require informed consent. 4.2. Dataset This study utilized combination of two carefully curated datasets specifically designed to evaluate the performance of agentic LLMs in retrieval-augmented radiology QA. We utilized two previously published datasets from the RadioRAG study18: the RSNA- RadioQA18 and ExtendedQA18 datasets. The RSNA-RadioQA dataset consists of 80 radiology questions derived from peer-reviewed cases available in the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Case Collection. This dataset covers 18 radiologic subspecialties, including breast imaging, chest radiology, gastrointestinal imaging, musculoskeletal imaging, neuroradiology, and pediatric radiology, among others. Each subspecialty contains at least five questions, carefully crafted from clinical histories and imaging descriptions provided in the original RSNA case documentation. Differential diagnoses explicitly listed by original case authors were excluded to avoid biasing model responses. Images were intentionally excluded. Detailed characteristics, including patient demographics and subspecialty distributions, have been previously published and are publicly accessible. The ExtendedQA consists of 24 unique, radiology-specific questions initially developed and validated by board-certified radiologists with substantial diagnostic radiology experience (5–14 years). These questions reflect realistic clinical diagnostic scenarios not previously available online or included in known LLM training datasets. The final RadioRAG dataset used in this study subsequently contains 104 questions combining both RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA. 4.2.1. Dataset postprocessing To ensure consistent evaluation all models and inference strategies, we applied structured preprocessing to the original RadioRAG dataset, particularly the ExtendedQA portion (n=24), which was initially formatted as open-ended questions. All questions from the RSNA-RadioQA dataset (n=80) were left unchanged. However, for the ExtendedQA subset, question was first converted into a multiple-choice format while preserving the original stem and correct answer. To standardize the evaluation across RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA, we then generated three high-quality distractor options for --- Page 22 --- 22 every question in the (n = 104), resulting in a total of four answer choices per item. Distractors were generated using OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o3 models, selected for ability to produce clinically plausible and contextually challenging alternatives. Prompts were designed to elicit difficult distractors, including common misconceptions, closely related entities, or synonyms of the correct answer. This ensured that diagnostic complexity was maintained across all questions. A representative prompt used for distractor generation was: “I have a dataset of radiology questions that are currently open-ended, each with a correct answer provided. I want to transform these into multiple-choice questions (MCQs) by generating four answer options per question (one correct answer + three distractors). The distractors should be plausible and the level of difficulty must be high. If possible, include distractors that are synonyms, closely related concepts, or common misconceptions related to the correct answer.” Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the datasets this study. The original RSNA-RadioQA questions are publicly available through their original publication18. 4.3. Experimental Design 4.3.1. System architecture The experimental design centers on retrieval and reasoning framework adapted from LangChain’s Open Deep Research pipeline, specifically tailored for QA tasks. As illustrated in Figure 1, the pipeline employs a structured, multi-agent workflow designed to produce comprehensive, evidence-based diagnostic reports for each multiple-choice question. The reasoning and content-generation process is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini model, selected for its proficiency in complex reasoning tasks, robust instruction-following, and effective tool utilization. The architecture consists of two specialized agents: (i) a supervisor agent and (ii) a research agent, directed graph framework. State management within this directed graph framework ensures that all steps in the workflow remain consistent and coordinated. The system maintains a shared memory state, recording the research plan, retrieved evidence, completed drafts, and all agent interactions, enabling structured progression from planning through final synthesis. 4.3.2. Agentic preprocessing To enable structured, multi-step reasoning in agentic retrieval framework, we implemented a preprocessing step focused on diagnostic abstraction. For each in the RadioRAG dataset, we used the Mistral Large model to generate a concise, comma-separated summary of key clinical concepts. This step was designed to extract the essential diagnostic elements of each question while filtering out rhetorical structure, instructional phrasing (e.g., “What is the most likely --- Page 23 --- 23 diagnosis?”), and other non-clinical language. These keyword summaries served exclusively as internal inputs to guide the agentic system’s retrieval process and were not shown to the LLMs as part of the actual question content. The intent was to ensure retrieval was driven by the clinical essence of the question rather than superficial linguistic cues. The used for keyword extraction was: “Extract and summarize the key clinical details from the following radiology question. Provide summary of keywords and key phrases in one sentence only. Question: {question_text}. Summary:” 4.3.3. Agent roles and responsibilities The is coordinated primarily by two agents, each with distinct responsibilities: (i) and (ii) research agent. The supervisor acts as the central orchestrator of the pipeline. Upon receiving a question, the supervisor reviews the diagnostic keywords and multiple- choice options, then formulates structured research plan dividing the task into clearly defined sections, one each diagnostic option. This agent assigns tasks to individual research agents, each responsible for exploring a single diagnostic choice. Throughout the process, the supervisor ensures strict neutrality, focusing solely on evidence gathering rather than advocating for any particular option. After research agents complete their tasks, the supervisor synthesizes their outputs a final report, utilizing specialized tools to generate an objective introduction and conclusion. Each research agent independently conducts an in-depth analysis focused on one diagnostic option. Beginning with a clear directive from the supervisor, the research agent employs a structured retrieval strategy to obtain relevant evidence. This involves an initial focused query using only essential terms from the diagnostic option, followed by contextual queries combining these terms with clinical features from the question stem (e.g., imaging findings or patient demographics). If retrieval results are inadequate, the agent adaptively refines queries by simplifying terms or substituting synonyms. In cases where sufficient evidence is not available after four attempts, the agent explicitly documents this limitation. All retrieval tasks utilize Radiopaedia.org exclusively, ensuring clinical accuracy and reliability. After completing retrieval, research agent synthesizes findings a structured report segment, explicitly highlighting both and contradicting evidence. Each segment includes clearly formatted citations linking directly to source materials, ensuring transparency and verifiability. 4.3.4. Retrieval and writing tools To facilitate structured retrieval and writing processes, the pipeline utilizes a suite of specialized computational tools dynamically selected based on specific task requirements: (i) search tool, (ii) report structuring tools, and (iii) content generation tool. In the following, details of each tool is explained. --- Page 24 --- 24 The retrieval mechanism powered by a custom-built search tool leveraging a locally hosted instance of SearXNG, a privacy-oriented meta-search engine deployed within a containerized Docker environment. This setup ensures consistent and reproducible search results. To maintain quality and clinical reliability, the search tool restricts results exclusively to content from Radiopaedia.org through a two-layer filtering process: first by appending a “site:radiopaedia.org” clause to all queries, and subsequently by performing an explicit domain check on all retrieved results. Raw results are deduplicated and formatted into markdown bundles suitable for seamless integration into subsequent reasoning steps. The supervisor agent employs specific tools to structure the diagnostic report systematically. An initial Sections tool is used to outline the report into distinct diagnostic sections, aligning precisely with the multiple-choice options. Additional specialized tools generate standardized Introduction and Conclusion sections: the Introduction tool summarizes essential from the question, and the Conclusion tool objectively synthesizes findings from all diagnostic sections, emphasizing comparative diagnostic considerations without bias. The research agent utilizes a dedicated Section writing tool to construct standardized report segments. Each segment begins with a concise synthesis of retrieved evidence, followed by interpretive summaries clearly identifying points and contradicting each diagnostic choice. Citations are integrated inline, referencing specific Radiopaedia19 URLs for traceability. 4.3.5. Report assembly and persistence Upon completion of individual research segments, the supervisor agent compiles the final diagnostic report, verifying the completeness and quality of all sections. The resulting report, including introduction, detailed analysis of diagnostic options, and conclusion, is then immediately persisted in a robust manner. Reports are streamed incrementally into newline- delimited JSON (NDJSON) format, preventing data loss in case of interruptions. This storage method supports efficient resumption by checking previously completed entries, thus avoiding redundant processing. After processing all questions within a given batch, individual NDJSON entries are consolidated into a single comprehensive JSON file, facilitating downstream analysis and evaluation. 4.4. Baseline comparison systems Each model was evaluated under three configurations: (i) zero-shot prompting (conventional QA), (ii) traditional online RAG18, and (iii) proposed agentic retrieval framework. 4.4.1. Baseline 1: Zero-shot prompting pipeline In the zero-shot prompting baseline, models received no external retrieval assistance or context. Instead, each model was presented solely the multiple-choice the RadioRAG --- Page 25 --- 25 dataset (question stem and four diagnostic options) and prompted to select the correct answer based entirely on their pre-trained knowledge. Models generated their responses autonomously without iterative feedback, reasoning prompts, or additional information. The exact standardized used for this configuration is provided below: “You are a highly knowledgeable medical expert. Below is a multiple-choice radiology question. Read the question carefully. Provide correct answer by selecting the most appropriate option from A, B, C, or D. Question: {question} Options: {options}” 4.4.2. Baseline 2: Traditional online RAG pipeline The online RAG baseline was implemented following a state-of-the-art non-agentic retrieval framework previously developed question answering by Arasteh et al18. The system employs GPT-3.5-turbo to automatically extract up to five representative radiology keywords from each question, optimized experimentally to balance retrieval quality and efficiency. These keywords were used to retrieve relevant articles from Radiopaedia.org, with each article segmented into overlapping chunks of 1,000 tokens. Chunks were then converted into vector embeddings (OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002) and stored in a temporary vector database. Subsequently, the embedded original question was compared against this database to retrieve the top three matching text chunks based on cosine similarity. These retrieved chunks served as external context provided to each LLM alongside the original multiple-choice question. Models were then instructed to answer concisely based solely on this context, explicitly stating if the answer was unknown. multiple-choice radiology question accompanied by relevant context (report). First, read the report, and then question carefully. Use retrieved context to answer the question or D. Otherwise, if you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Report: {report} Options: {options}” --- Page [PHONE].5. Evaluation SW, JS, TTN, and STA performed model evaluations. We assessed both small and large-scale LLMs using responses 1–27, 2025. For each of the 104 questions benchmark dataset, models were integrated into a unified evaluation pipeline to ensure consistent testing conditions across all settings. The evaluation included 24 LLMs: and Gemma‑3‑27B‑it41,42. These models span range of parameter scales (from 0.5B to over 670B), training paradigms (instruction-tuned, reasoning-optimized, clinically aligned, and general-purpose), and access models (open-source, open-weights, or proprietary). They also reflect architectural diversity, including dense transformers and MoE43 systems. Full model specifications, including size, category, cutoff date, context length, and developer in Table 1. 4.5.1. Accuracy assessment Accuracy was determined by comparing each LLM's response the correct option. We used Mistral Large as an automated adjudicator for this process. For each multiple-choice question, both the LLM's response and correct answer (including its corresponding letter and option) were provided to Mistral Large via a standardized prompt. Mistral Large was instructed to respond "Yes" if correct answer was present in the model's response, either explicitly or as a clear component of the explanation, even if the phrasing differed. Otherwise, it to respond "No." A "Yes" was scored as 1 (correct), and a "No" scored as 0 (incorrect), ensuring a consistent and unbiased measure of diagnostic accuracy. medical expert. Determine whether the Correct Answer appears within the LLMs response, fully a clear if the wording differs. Respond with ‘Yes’ if Correct Answer can be found in the LLMs response; otherwise respond with ‘No’. LLMs response: {llms_response} Correct Answer: {correct_answer}” --- Page [PHONE].5.2. Factuality assessment evaluate the factual reliability of model outputs a targeted across all the RadioRAG benchmark18. This analysis aimed to differentiate model errors due to flawed reasoning from those caused by insufficient or irrelevant evidence, and to assess the extent to which final answers were grounded in the retrieved context. Each agentic interventional radiology. For every question, the following three criteria were assessed: the retrieved Radiopaedia was clinically relevant to the question, the model's final answer was consistent with the answer classified as clinically off-topic content with respect the diagnostic question. This strict definition ensured that relevance was not based on superficial keyword overlap but on the actual clinical utility of the content. Retrievals were deemed relevant only the retrieved material included appropriate imaging findings, clinical clues, or differential diagnoses applicable to the question stem. Hallucinations were defined as cases which model produced an incorrect answer despite being provided with clinically relevant context. These represent failures of reasoning or synthesis rather than of retrieval. Given the high-stakes nature of radiologic diagnosis, identifying such errors is essential for understanding model reliability and safety. We also documented instances where models answered questions correctly despite being supplied with irrelevant or unhelpful context. These “correct irrelevant context” cases reflect scenarios the model relied on internal knowledge rather than external grounding. While not classified as hallucinations, these responses raise questions about the transparency, traceability, and consistency of absence of meaningful retrieval. 4.5.3. Time analysis the computational cost associated we measured response times for both prompting retrieval framework using the 104- question RadioRAG benchmark. Timing logs were collected from structured output directories for each model. A fixed initialization overhead of 10,554.6 per model, arising from the context construction phase unique to agentic inference, was distributed uniformly all questions, resulting in an adjusted increase of per question. To ensure robust comparison and mitigate influence of extreme values, outlier durations were handled using the Tukey method50. Specifically, any response time that exceeded the typical upper range, defined as values greater than the third quartile by more than 1.5 times the interquartile range, was considered an outlier and replaced with the mean of the remaining non-outlier values for that model and inference strategy. For each model, we computed the mean --- Page 28 --- 28 and standard deviation of response times under both conditions. Additionally, we calculated the absolute difference per question and the relative increase, defined as mean agentic response mean zero-shot response time. To contextualize timing behavior across a heterogeneous model set, we grouped models according to both and architectural characteristics. This grouping approach reflected the practical computational load of each model more accurately than parameter count alone. Six distinct groups were defined: (i) the DeepSeek MoE group, including DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek‑V3; (ii) model group (120–250 billion including Qwen 3- 235B, Llama4 Scout 16E; (iii) group (~70B), comprising DeepSeek R1-70B, Llama3.3-70B, Qwen2.5‑70B, and Llama3-Med42-70B; (iv) the Gemma‑27B group, containing Gemma-3-27B-it and MedGemma-27B-text-it; (v) model group (7– 8B), including Qwen 2.5-70B, Qwen3‑8B, Llama3‑Med42‑8B, Llama3.3-8B, and Ministral-8B; and (vi) model group (3–4B), consisting of and Qwen 2.5- 3B. Group-level averages and standard deviations were calculated across constituent models and reported in Table 4. All timing evaluations were performed identical system conditions to ensure fair comparisons. While response times may vary with hardware and load, the relative increases provide a stable and interpretable metric for assessing the computational implications of agentic retrieval. 4.5.4. Human evaluation To benchmark LLM performance against domain expertise, conducted a human evaluation interventional radiology. The evaluation followed a two-phase design to mirror the LLM configurations. In the first phase, the radiologist 104 RadioRAG benchmark without any external assistance, analogous to zero-shot prompting. The expert was blinded to the LLM responses, dataset construction process, and reference standard answers. Responses were recorded as final, and no additional time or information resources were permitted during this phase. In the second phase, we aimed contribution agentic retrieval component, of generative reasoning. For this, same radiologist was provided with the contextual evidence agentic system for each question, same Radiopaedia excerpts that were used as inputs for LLM agentic inference. The radiologist answered the same 104 questions again, this time using context as decision support, access the original question-answer pairs or their previous responses. The format and presentation of contextual evidence were identical to what the LLMs received during agentic inference, ensuring comparability. This design enabled us to disentangle the effects of information retrieval from language model reasoning, by comparing unaided radiologist performance, radiologist performance with --- Page 29 --- 29 context, and agentic LLM outputs under standardized conditions. Accuracy was computed using the same evaluation criteria applied to LLMs. Statistical comparisons between human and model responses were performed on paired question-level outcomes. Confidence intervals and p-values were discovery rate. 4.6. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Python v3.11 with SciPy v1.10, NumPy v1.25.2, and statsmodels v0.14.5 packages. For each dataset, with 1,000 redraws was used to estimate means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals (CI)51. A strictly paired design ensured identical redraws across conditions52. To assess statistical significance of pairwise method comparisons all LLMs, exact McNemar's test53 (based on the binomial distribution) was applied to each model individually. Resulting p-values were corrected false discovery rate, with a significance threshold of 0.05. For group-level comparisons between inference strategies (e.g., zero-shot vs. agentic RAG), paired two tailed t- tests used to compare average accuracy across models. To explore size and performance, correlation coefficients were computed between parameter counts and accuracy values within model family, separately inference strategy. 4.7. Data availability All data are available via either original RadioRAG publication18. 4.8. Code availability All source code, configurations, and parameters in this work are publicly available. The agentic RAG pipeline, developed in Python 3.11, is available at: https://github.com/sopajeta/agentic-rag. Our implementation relies on several key frameworks and tools. We used LangChain Deep Research (https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep- research) for experimental agent modules, LangChain v0.3.25 (https://github.com/langchain- ai/langchain) for orchestration and agent management, and LangGraph v0.4.1 (https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) to support multi-step control flow and task decomposition. Model access and embedding generation were handled via the OpenAI Python SDK v1.77.0 (https://platform.openai.com). The SearxNG metasearch engine (https://github.com/searxng/searxng) was also deployed via Docker v25.0.2 (https://www.docker.com) and used for online web retrieval. --- Page 30 --- 30 RAG pipeline is hosted at https://github.com/tayebiarasteh/RadioRAG, which relies on the LangChain v0.1.0, Chroma (https://www.trychroma.com) for vector storage, and the OpenAI API v1.12 for embeddings.

Hardware For the majority of experiments, particularly those involving standard LLMs, the computations were performed on GPU nodes equipped with Nvidia H100 and H200 accelerators. The H100 configuration consisted of four Nvidia H100 GPUs, each providing 94 GB of HBM2e memory and operating at a 500 W powerlimit. These GPUs were paired with two AMD EPYC 9554 “Genoa” processors based on the Zen 4 architecture, each offering 64 high‑performance cores running at 3.1 GHz. The H200 configuration featured four Nvidia H200 GPUs, each offering 141 GB of high‑bandwidth memory also at 500 W, coupled to the same dual EPYC 9554 processor configuration. This combination of high‑end Nvidia accelerators from NHR@FAU’s Helma Cluster --- Page 31 --- 31 (https://doc.nhr.fau.de/clusters/helma/) provided the necessary computational capabilities for inferencing majority of the LLMs used during our experiments. Experiments involving extremely large‑scale architectures, as the DeepSeek R1 or V3 model and other similarly demanding workloads, were executed on equipped with AMD’s MI300‑series accelerators. In these cases, the MI300X configuration was utilized, which combined a dual‑socket AMD EPYC 9474F platform with total of 96 CPU cores and 2304 GiB of DDR5‑5600 system memory, together with eight AMD Instinct MI300X accelerators. Each MI300X GPU offered 192 GiB of memory, enabling inference runs that required massive counts and exceptional memory capacity (Deepseek R1 with 671 billion parameters). Additional experimentation also leveraged AMD Instinct MI300A nodes that integrate 24‑core CPUs with unified on‑package memory, total of 512 GiB shared across four accelerators. The hardware used in our experiments included a local machine with an Intel Pentium CPU with 2 cores and 8 GB Memory for consuming API endpoints. 5. Additional information 5.1.

Question identifier LLM’s (GPT-3.5-turbo) answer Most relevant sources RSNA-RadioQA-Q1 A: BI-RADS 4 - Suspicious abnormality requiring biopsy: BI-RADS 4 lesions are characterized by suspicious findings with an intermediate risk of malignancy. The presence of rim calcifications within a fat-containing mass raises concern for malignancy. Biopsy is generally recommended for BI-RADS 4 lesions, especially if calcifications are suspicious. B: BI-RADS 2 - Rim Calcifications: Rim calcifications in fat-containing masses are typically benign and classified as BI-RADS 2. These calcifications are often associated with benign processes like fat necrosis or oil cysts. The imaging features of a round, circumscribed fat-containing mass with rim calcifications align with a benign diagnosis. C: BI-RADS 3 - Probably benign finding: BI-RADS 3 category is designated for probably benign lesions with a low likelihood of malignancy. Fat-containing lesions rim calcifications may fall into this category if they demonstrate typical benign features. Short-interval follow-up is for BI-RADS 3 lesions to monitor for any interval changes. D: Oil cyst secondary to fat necrosis: Oil cysts are benign lesions resulting from fat necrosis, often following trauma or surgery. These cysts typically present as fat-containing masses with rim calcifications, consistent with the imaging findings described. The absence of a clear history of trauma or surgery does not exclude the possibility of an oil cyst. Conclude with a Final Answer: Based on the analysis of imaging findings and the differential diagnosis in the report, most likely diagnosis for the 66-year-old female with a palpable right breast lump at 10 o'clock, characterized by rim calcifications on mammography, is: to fat necrosis. Reasoning: presence rim calcifications or surgery aligns with the typical features an oil fat necrosis. benign lesions associated with fat necrosis and characterized by presence of fat within the lesion and calcifications on mammography. This diagnosis is further by the benign nature in fat-containing masses, typically BI-RADS 2. Therefore, considering findings and clinical context, most likely explanation for the palpable abnormality in this case is fat necrosis. https://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-imaging- reporting-and-data-system-bi-rads-assessment- category-4, https://radiopaedia.org/cases/suspicious- breast-calcifications-bi-rads-4, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fat-containing-breast- lesions, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast- calcifications, https://radiopaedia.org/cases/screening- mammography-rim-calcifications, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-imaging- reporting-and-data-system-bi-rads-assessment- category-2, https://radiopaedia.org/cases/breast- calcification-bi-rads-2, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-imaging- reporting-and-data-system-bi-rads-assessment- category-3, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fat- necrosis-breast-2, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-imaging- reporting-and-data-system-bi-rads-2, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oil-cyst-breast RSNA-RadioQA-Q2 A: Low-grade fibrosarcoma: Low-grade fibrosarcoma is a rare malignant mesenchymal tumor characterized by spindle cell morphology with a herringbone pattern. Immunohistochemical markers for fibrosarcoma often include vimentin positivity, but specific markers can vary. Beta- catenin nuclear staining is typically absent in fibrosarcomas, which helps differentiate them from other entities. absence of nuclear beta-catenin staining in the presented case suggests low- grade fibrosarcoma is less likely.

Title: GLiDRE: Generalist Lightweight model for Document-level Relation Extraction Authors: Robin Armingaud, Romaric Besançon Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00757v1 --- Page 1 --- Relation Extraction Romaric Besançon Université Paris-Saclay, CEA, List, F-91120, Palaiseau, France {robin.armingaud, romaric.besancon}@cea.fr Abstract Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing, and its document-level variant poses significant chal- lenges, due to the need to model complex inter- actions between entities across sentences. Cur- rent approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly evaluated on bench- marks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. How- ever, their performance in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored to the task’s complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar motivation, we intro- duce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against state-of-the-art models across various data set- tings on the Re-DocRED dataset. Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of- the-art performance in few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available1. 1 Introduction Relation Extraction (DocRE) is a challenging task in natural language processing that involves identifying relationships between en- tities across multiple sentences. In contrast, tradi- tional sentence-level relation extraction, evaluated on supervised datasets like TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017) and SemEval-2010 Task 8 (Hendrickx et al., 2010) or few-shot benchmarks such as FewREL (Han et al., 2018) and Wiki-ZSL (Chen and Li, 2021), typically considers a single entity pair per instance, often without negative examples (i.e. sen- tences where no relation is present). These settings closely resemble relation classification rather than relation extraction. While recent works improve existing benchmarks, like FewRel 2.0 (Gao et al., 2019) which addresses the negative examples issue, 1https://github.com/robinarmingaud/glidre they still operate under the constraint of classifying a fixed pair of entities. DocRE presents a more realistic and complex scenario, especially relevant for real-world appli- cations such as Information Extraction (IE) in biomedical or industrial texts, where relationships often span sentence boundaries and the entity pairs of interest are not pre-identified. The complexity of DocRE is to the quadratic growth of negative pairs with the number of entities in a document. Evaluation is commonly conducted on datasets like DocRED (Yao al., 2019) and its revised version Re-DocRED (Tan et al., 2022b), which reduces the issue of false negatives. These two datasets con- tain more complex documents with an average of 19 entities and approximately 390 candidate pairs per text, for a total of 3,053 annotated Wikipedia articles in the training set. State-of-the-art approaches to DocRE generally extend the model ATLOP (Zhou et al., 2021), which introduces Localized Context Pooling, using attention mechanisms to enhance relation repre- sentations, and an adaptive-thresholding loss that adjusts decision thresholds dynamically based on entity pairs. Subsequent work has extended AT- LOP in various directions. For example, DREEAM (Ma et al., 2023) uses evidences to enhance perfor- mance, while KD-DocRE et al., 2022a) uses axial attention to model interdependencies among entity pairs, adopts an adaptive focal loss to ad- dress class imbalance, and integrates knowledge distillation. However, if recent works tackle sentence-level relation extraction in low-resource settings (Boy- lan et al., 2025, Li et al., 2024a, Lan et al., 2023), DocRE in similar remains largely unex- plored. Although latest LLMs show strong capa- bilities in zero-shot settings for tasks such as NER and RE (Sainz et al., 2024, Zhou et al., 2023, Wang al., 2023, Wei al., 2023), their performance on zero-shot DocRE, especially on the DocRED or 1 arXiv:2508.00757v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- Figure 1: Model architecture. GLiDRE uses a dual-encoder structure: a text encoder generates token embeddings, while a label encoder computes embeddings for relation types. An entity’s representation is formed by pooling the embeddings of its constituent tokens and mentions. For each entity pair, their representations are concatenated and processed by a feed-forward network before final scoring. The model can optionally incorporate a localized context pooling module, inspired by ATLOP, to enrich the relation representation. Re-DocRED dataset is still limited (Li al., 2023, Xue et al., 2024). The recent success of GLiNER (Zaratiana et al., 2024) has motivated this work. GLiNER deals with the task of NER as matching entity type representations to textual span represen- tations in the latent space. This approach allows better representations than LLMs due to its use of bidirectional encoders and it solves the scalability issues of autoregressive models, surpassing much larger LLMs in zero shot settings. Moreover, as a zero-shot model, GLiNER is not restricted to a fixed set of relation labels and can generalize to arbitrary relation types at inference time. Based on this work, we introduce GLiDRE, a model inspired by the bi-encoder version of GLiNER2, adapted for DocRE. Our contributions in this paper are : • We propose a new and efficient document-level relation extraction, by the core principles of GLiNER. We also adapt and test key components from ATLOP to improve relation representations. • We conduct extensive experiments the Re-DocRED benchmark, demonstrating GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art results in challenging few-shot scenarios. • We demonstrate that smaller, specialized en- coder models can offer an efficient alternative 2https://blog.knowledgator.com/meet-the-new-z ero-shot-ner-architecture-30ffc2cb1ee0 to larger LLMs for complex, relation extraction and we present an up-to- date evaluation of these models on the Re- DocRED dataset in a zero-shot setting. 2 Methodology 2.1 Document Level Relation Extraction Let a document be represented as a sequence of tokens D. Within this document, there is a set of m pre-identified entities E = {e1, e2, . . . , em}, where each entity ei is associated with one or more mentions in the text. The objective DocRE is to identify valid rela- tional triplets. Each triplet is of the form (eh, r, et), where eh, et ∈E are the head and tail entities re- spectively (h can be equal to t), and r is the relation that holds between them. on this definition, DocRE is as a multi-label classification task. 2.2 GLiDRE architecture GLiDRE extends the bi-encoder variant of GLiNER. This architecture employs two separate transformers, one for encoding the document and another for encoding relation labels, which offers several benefits : unlike the uni-encoder version, the bi-encoder approach avoids concatenating la- bels and document tokens into a single input. In- stead, we encode document and labels sepa- rately. This eliminates the need for special separa- tion tokens and overcomes encoder context length 2 --- Page 3 --- limits, permitting an effectively unlimited label set. Moreover, label embeddings can be precomputed, accelerating inference. However, the bi-encoder architecture increases memory usage and lacks cross-attention between labels. As a result, it may struggle to disambiguate semantically similar la- bels. Label and word representations Label embed- dings are obtained by mean-pooling over the to- ken representations constituting label names. The computed label embeddings are passed through a two-layer feedforward network if the dimension of the label encoder’s output differs from the con- figured latent space dimension of GLiDRE. For document tokens, we adopt the standard strategy used in GLiNER and other standard NER mod- els : for words split into subwords, we extract the representation of the first subword. Relation representations Given contextual em- beddings H ∈RL×D from the document encoder, where L is the sequence length and D is the hidden of document encoder, we construct a representation for each candidate relation defined by a of entities. First, for each mention of an entity, we compute the mention representation pooling the embed- dings its constituent words. If an entity has multiple mentions, its final repre- sentation he is derived by taking the mean of all its mention representations. Finally, the representation hr for the relation between eh and et, is obtained by concatenating their respective entity representations and passing them two-layer feedforward network. hr = FFN(heh ⊗het) (1) where ⊗denotes vector concatenation. Relation Scoring To determine whether a candi- date entity pair (eh, et) instantiates a given relation type t, we measure the following matching score between the relation representation hr and the em- bedding of relation type ht : s(eh, et, t) = σ(h⊤ r ht) (2) where σ(x) = (1+e−x)−1 is the sigmoid function. A relation t is assigned to the (eh, et) if et, t) > τ (3) where τ is a predefined decision threshold. 2.3 Loss Function To address issue of class imbalance within DocRE datasets, we use the Focal Loss function proposed by Lin et al. (2017) during training. The Focal Loss is a dynamically scaled cross-entropy loss designed to down-weight the contribution of well-classified examples and concentrating the training on hard examples. It is defined as: FL(pt) = −αt(1 −pt)γ log(pt) (4) where pt represents the model’s estimated prob- ability for the ground-truth class. The focusing parameter γ adjusts the rate at which easy exam- ples are down-weighted and the weighting factor αt balances the importance of positive and negative examples. 2.4 Localized Context Pooling To create more refined representations, we also ex- plore and adapt methods inspired by et al., 2021) including Localized Context Pooling. Context Pooling uses the attention scores from the encoder to focus on the most relevant parts the document for a given entity pair. Let A ∈RL×L be the document-level attention matrix from the last encoder layer, averaged across all attention heads. For the head entity eh and tail entity et, we extract their corresponding attention vectors Ah and At by averaging attention scores over their mention tokens. A joint attention vector α is computed via an element-wise product: α = Ah ⊙At (5) This α is then normalized and used to compute a weighted sum of the contextual embeddings, creat- ing localized context vector cloc: cloc = L X i=1 αi PL j=1 αj Hi (6) Finally, the refined representations for the head h′ and tail h′ et entities are created by concatenat- ing their initial representations with the context vector them through distinct two-layer feedforward network: h′ eh = tanh(FFNh(heh ⊗cloc)) (7) h′ et = tanh(FFNt(het ⊗cloc)) (8) The final representation hr is then com- puted using Equation 1. 3 --- Page 4 --- 2.5 Pretraining data To construct a large-scale pre-training corpus, we use a semi-automated annotation methodology in- spired by Zhou et al. (2023). We randomly sample documents from FineWeb (Penedo et al., 2024), a high-quality dataset built from filtered and dedupli- cated English Common Crawl archives. We prompt the Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501 model to generate annotations for both entities and the relations between them in a structured JSON format (the detailed prompt is provided in appendix A.1). The raw outputs are filtered to remove in- stances containing malformed JSON or documents that exceed a predefined length threshold. The resulting dataset contains 136,404 docu- ments with highly diverse labels, featuring 76,497 unique relation types. The most frequent rela- tion types include types such as IS_LOCATED_IN, WORKS_FOR, PART_OF and CONTAINS. We use this dataset to pretrain our model. 3 Experiments 3.1 Dataset We conduct our on the English bench- mark al., 2022b), a human- revised version of the DocRED benchmark that addresses its high false-negative rate, logical incon- sistencies and coreference errors by re-annotating all 4,053 documents in the original training and evaluation splits. Re-DocRED retains the same re- lation schema and splits but substantially increases number of annotated relation triples per docu- ment. 3.2 Evaluation Settings We evaluate the performance of our model across three distinct experimental settings, with a particu- lar focus on low-data regimes where its advantages are most pronounced. First, in a fully supervised setting, we fine-tune on the entire training set and compare against strong baselines. Second, to as- sess data efficiency and few-shot generalization, fine-tune on randomly sampled subsets of the training data containing 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 examples. Finally, we examine zero-shot performance by comparing against larger LLMs without any task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting the model’s competitiveness in scenarios with little or no labeled data. Evaluation Metrics We use the standard metrics from the Re-DocRED dataset, defined in Tan et al. (2022b): F1 refers to the micro-averaged F1 score on the recognition of relation triples, Ign_F1 corre- sponds to the F1 score when ignoring the triples in the test set that appear also training set. Implementation Details All experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU with a batch size of 16. For the pre-training phase, the model is trained for 50,000 steps. For finetuning, we train for 10,000 steps. We use two learning rates 1×10−5 for the model’s encoders and 1×10−4 for all other layers. For the few-shot and fully super- vised experiments, we report the average and stan- dard deviation over 5 runs with different seeds. The model checkpoint yielding the best performance on the development set and a decision threshold of 0.5 are used for the evaluation on the test set. use two English models : DebertaV3 Large (He al., 2021) for document encoder and BGE-Large V1.5 (Xiao al., 2023) for label encoder similar to version of GLiNER. The final model comprises approximately 800 million parameters. The pre-training phase requires approximately 24 hours, while finetuning on the ReDocRED dataset takes 3.5 hours. 3.3 Results 3.3.1 Fully supervised setting of our proposed model, GLiDRE, by comparing it against several strong baselines the Re-DocRED dataset under fully supervised protocol. Specifically, we include: • et al., 2021): Formu- lates relation extraction as a semantic-segmentation task, introducing context pooling to capture entity- focused local contexts and an adaptive thresh- olding loss to learn dynamic decision thresh- olds. • et al., 2022a): Leverages an axial attention module to model inter-entity dependencies across sentences, applies loss to mitigate class imbalance and uses knowledge distillation to incorporate distantly supervised data. • et al., 2023): Guides the model’s attention with evidence sentences as supervisory signals in a memory-efficient 4 --- Page 5 --- manner and employs a self-training strategy to learn evidence retrieval without explicit an- notations. • TTM-RE et al., 2024): Introduces a To- ken Turing Machine memory module that aug- ments document representations with external memory tokens, paired with a noise-robust loss tailored for positive–unlabeled distantly supervised settings. Additionally, we benchmark against GLiREL (Boylan et al., 2025), a GLiNER relation extraction adaptation. It is important to note that GLiREL was originally conceived for extraction and operates with a shorter context length. For document-level pre- dictions, it relies on aggregating relations based on gold-standard coreference information. We also benchmark against recent methods that leverage LLMs. Specifically, we compare with the framework introduced by Li et al. (2024b), which involves fine-tuning Llama models (Touvron al., 2023) using Low-Rank Adaptation (Hu et al., 2022) and enhancing the model’s performance by employ- ing a classifier to exhibit potential relations and guide the fine-tuned LLM. The results of our experiments presented in Ta- ble 1, GLiDRE achieves strong and competitive the Re-DocRED benchmark. Our model attains a test F1 score of 77.83. This places GLiDRE in close competition with established DocRE models like ATLOP and KD-DocRE. While it does not surpass the current state-of-the-art methods like DREEAM and TTM- RE, it note that these models incor- porate additional mechanisms, such as evidence informations for DREEAM and the Turing Token Machine for TTM-RE that is designed to scale bet- ter than our approach with large datasets. Critically, GLiDRE outperforms LLM-based methods. It surpasses the best-performing LMRC approach by over 3 F1 points, despite being a signif- icantly smaller and more computationally efficient model. This highlights the strength of specialized encoder architectures for this task compared to fine- tuning general-purpose LLMs. Furthermore, the comparison with GLiREL high- lights importance of our architectural adapta- tions for the document-level context. By designing representations specifically for relation extraction at the document level, GLiDRE achieves an im- provement of over 23 F1 points. 3.3.2 Low-Resource Settings In low-resource scenarios, we evaluate the ef- ficiency or our model it against two powerful supervised baselines. We selected DREEAM, as it represents the state-of-the-art on the fully-supervised benchmark, and ATLOP, whose architecture and performances share sim- ilarities with our approach. This comparison designed to determine the dataset size at which these conventional supervised methods can match our model and quantifying the advantages of our approach in data-scarce regimes. The results presented in Table 2 clearly demon- strate the superiority of GLiDRE in data-scarce environments. In the extremely low-data regime (N ≤100), our model establishes a lead over both ATLOP and the state-of-the-art model, DREEAM. For instance, with only 10 training samples, achieves an score of 41.73, surpass- ing DREEAM by a margin of over 14 F1 points. This significant advantage persists up to N=100 samples. As the amount of training data increases to 500 and 1000 samples, the performance gap narrows, and the baselines become more competitive. This indicates that while conventional supervised meth- ods eventually catch up, our model’s architecture provides a distinct and substantial advantage when labeled data is minimal. 3.3.3 Zero-Shot Setting The zero-shot setting for Document-Level Rela- tion Extraction remains a largely underexplored research area. Given the scarcity of existing base- lines, we establish a benchmark by evaluating performance of much larger open-weight Language Models. We selected good performing models from the Open LLM Leaderboard (Fourrier al., 2024), specifically employing the instruction- tuned versions of Qwen 2.5 72B (Team, 2024), Mistral Large 123B3, Llama 3.3 70B4 and the model we used for synthetic pretraining generation, Mistral-Small 24B. Our prompting methodology is inspired by recent work in zero-shot Information Extraction (Yuan et al., 2023). We annotate entity mentions directly within the input text using spe- cial tags and to ensure structured and reliable out- puts, we constrain the generation process to a strict 3https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Lar ge-Instruct-2411 4https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3 -70B-Instruct 5 --- Page 6 --- Table 1: Fully supervised results Re-DocRED dataset. We compare GLiDRE with strong DocRE models, LLM-based methods and GLiREL. F1 scores are reported on both the development and test sets. Results are taken from the original papers, except for DocRE models, which are reported following Gao et al. (2024).

This constrained decoding is implemented using regular expressions within the vLLM inference framework (Kwon al., 2023), which facilitates parsing and mitigates the risk of hallucination. The detailed prompt template used this task provided in Figure 2. We use a fixed temperature of 0. of our zero-shot evaluation, detailed in Table 3, highlight the efficiency and effective- ness of GLiDRE. We establish a strong benchmark by comparing our model against several state-of- the-art LLMs. Our primary finding is that a model with only a few hundred million parameters, achieves performance that is competitive with LLMs orders of magnitude larger. With score of 17.32, GLiDRE outperforms Llama 3.3 70B and Mistral-Small 24B. This demonstrates that for specialized tasks like DocRE, a focused bi- encoder architecture can rival the zero-shot reason- ing capabilities of massive general-purpose models. Furthermore, the results show a dramatic improve- ment when compared to the score of GPT-3.5 Turbo reported by Xue et al. (2024), showing the rapid recent progress of LLMs Information Extraction tasks. Beyond performance, GLiDRE offers significant practical advantages. The LLM baselines entail substantial computational overhead, requiring vast memory footprints (e.g., over 300 GB for Mistral- Large and at least 4 A100-80GB) and significant energy consumption for inference. In contrast, GLiDRE with a memory footprint of un- der 10 GB. Moreover, LLMs often require com- plex engineering, including sophisticated prompt- ing and constrained decoding, to produce struc- tured, parsable outputs and mitigate hallucinations, while our model natively produces structured pre- dictions. The performance of GLiDRE shows some vari- ability, which may come from a misalignment be- tween their general-purpose pre-training corpora 6 --- Page 7 --- and the specific domain and relations of Re- DocRED dataset. Adapting its pre-training by gen- erating synthetic data with relation types aligned to the target dataset, as was done with GLiNER for Personally Identifiable Informations5, could im- prove results. However, this would likely reduce its ability to generalize to other DocRE datasets. Figure 2: The used for zero-shot DocRE inference with LLMs. Entity mentions are marked with special tags to ground the model and the output format is strictly constrained to triplets to ensure parsability and reduce invalid generations. 3.4 Analysis 3.4.1 LogSumExp vs. Mean Pooling LogSumExp (LSE) pooling serves as a smooth approximation of the max pooling operation. The operation defined as: LSE(x1, ..., xn) = log n X i=1 exp(xi) ! This pooling strategy was successfully applied to relation extraction by Jia et al. (2019) and later adopted by ATLOP, where it showed slightly better performances over conven- tional mean pooling. However, our empirical results, shown in Table 4, indicate a different outcome within our archi- tecture. For GLiDRE, conventional mean pooling 5https://huggingface.co/urchade/gliner_multi_ pii-v1 outperforms LSE by nearly a full F1 point set. We attribute this discrepancy to archi- tectural differences; unlike ATLOP’s bilinear clas- sifier, GLiDRE employs a bi-encoder framework that compares relation and type embeddings. This structural divergence suggests that optimizations are not always directly transferable between mod- els. Given that the original ATLOP paper reported only minor gains from LSE, our findings confirm that mean pooling is a more effective and robust choice for our model. Table 4: Comparison of F1 scores test set using LogSumExp versus Mean pooling for entity mention aggregation. Pooling Method Ign F1 LogSumExp 76.86±0.15 75.72±0.20 Mean 77.83±0.23 76.80±0.22 3.4.2 Effect of Pre-training and Context Pooling We conduct an ablation study to isolate the individ- ual contributions of our synthetic pre-training stage and the Context Pooling (noted LOP in the ATLOP model) mechanism. Two variants our model are evaluated: one finetuned without pre-training and another without the LOP module. The results in Table 5 confirm that both compo- nents positively contribute to the final performance of GLiDRE. Removing the pre-training stage leads to the most significant performance decrease, with a drop of nearly 0.7 F1 points, underscoring the effectiveness our synthetic data generation for model initialization. Disabling LOP results in drop of 0.2 F1 points, which validates its role in refining relation representations. These findings justify the inclusion of both techniques in our final model architecture.

This is achieved by adding a special "threshold" (TH) class to the classifier; a relation is predicted only if its logit surpasses that of the TH class. Adapting this to GLiDRE is non-trivial due to our model’s bi-encoder architecture, which lacks a fixed classifier head. To replicate the mechanism, we introduce a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the threshold logit. The MLP input is a concatenation of the candidate relation’s embed- ding and a global context vector, formed by aver- aging all possible relation type embeddings. The model is then trained using original ATLOP loss function. To save compute resources, this experiment is conducted on the model variant without pre- training. As in Table 6, this adaptation proved detrimental, degrading performance by ap- proximately 1.4 F1 points. We hypothesize several reasons for this negative result: (1) our method of computing the threshold logit via a separate MLP is fundamentally different from ATLOP’s integrated classifier approach; (2) the ATLOP loss may be less effective at handling the severe class imbal- ance in DocRED to Focal Loss used in our main model; (3) a dynamic threshold may be unnecessary our model. We observed that the optimal global threshold for GLiDRE consis- tently converges near 0.5 and further tuning per- class thresholds development set did not improve test set performance.

Ign F1 Focal Loss 77.15±0.42 75.96±0.49 Adaptive Threshold 75.74±1.05 74.84±1.05 4 Conclusion We present GLiDRE, a novel lightweight bi-encoder document-level relation ex- traction that reconceptualizes Document-level Re- lation Extraction as a direct representation match- ing problem. We show, through extensive ex- periments Re-DocRED benchmark, achieves state-of-the-art few-shot perfor- mance and matches or surpasses in zero-shot settings, all while operating with a frac- tion of their computational footprint. GLiDRE not only rivals fully supervised base- lines under low-resource regimes but also deliv- ers highly structured predictions without complex prompting or constrained decoding. Its efficiency makes it a practical choice for real-world IE appli- cations. Future work will explore synthetic relation gener- ation to further close remaining performance gaps and investigate dynamic thresholding methods tai- lored the bi-encoder setup to enhance robustness across diverse relation schemas. Limitations Despite its efficiency and strong few-shot perfor- mance, GLiDRE faces several inherent limitations. First, number of candidate relation pairs grows 8 --- Page 9 --- quadratically in a doc- ument, which can dramatically increase memory consumption for texts with high entity density and even lead to out-of-memory errors. Second, al- though the bi-encoder design can in principle ac- commodate longer contexts, it remains bound by the maximum sequence length of the underlying document encoder (e.g. 512 tokens for DeBERTa). Documents that exceed this limit must be truncated or segmented into chunks, potentially disrupting long-distance dependencies and harming perfor- mance. Third, GLiDRE’s independent scoring of each entity-relation pair overlooks inter-label interac- tions. result, it can struggle to distinguish semantically similar relation types in the absence of a joint classification mechanism. Finally, our evaluation follows standard DocRE protocols by assuming gold entities and coreference chains are provided. Since GLiDRE does not perform named entity recognition or coreference resolution, its ef- fectiveness a fully end-to-end pipeline would de- pend on the accuracy of upstream modules, which may propagate errors and degrade overall perfor- mance.

Title: MMBERT: Scaled Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal BERT for Robust Chinese Hate Speech Detection under Cloaking Perturbations Authors: Qiyao Xue, Yuchen Dou, Ryan Shi, Xiang Lorraine Li, Wei Gao Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00760v1 --- Page 1 --- Cloaking Perturbations Qiyao Xue Yuchen Dou Ryan Shi Xiang Lorraine Li Wei Gao University of Pittsburgh {qix63, yud105, ryanshi, xianglli, weigao}@pitt.edu Abstract Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques designed to evade conventional text- based detection systems. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection capa- bilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the insta- bility associated with directly integrating MoE into BERT- based models, we develop a progressive three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy to enhance robustness against adversar- ial perturbations. Empirical results in several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing in-context learning approaches. Introduction Hate speech poses a persistent threat to online communities, exacerbated by the anonymity and scale of digital platforms (Dixon et al. 2018). While automated hate speech detec- tion has advanced significantly in recent years, most efforts remain concentrated on English, leaving other major lan- guages like Chinese relatively under-resourced and under- protected (Davidson et al. 2017; Davidson, Bhattacharya, and Weber 2019). Some researchers have attempted to lever- age LLMs for speech detection (Chao et al. 2024; Sun et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2023). However, on Chi- nese social media platforms, many hate speech dissemina- tors employ various cloaking perturbations to escape detec- tion, making it challenging for existing models to identify such expressions accurately (Xiao et al. 2024). These subtle manipulations exploit the structural and phonological prop- erties of the Chinese language, making detection especially difficult for text-only models. While LLMs have shown promise in content moderation, BERT-based architectures have consistently outperformed decoder-only LLMs in speech detection tasks, owing to their deep bidirectional encoding and strong capacity for fine-grained semantic understanding (Benayas, Sicilia, Audio Input Speech Encoder Vision Encoder Text Tokenizer Text-to-speech Model Speech Aligner Vision Aligner Self-Attention Classification Head MoE x N Image Input Text Input 那岂不是 子都不如 Vision Expert Progressively trainable Add & Norm & Norm MMBERT Word Embedding Trainable Frozen Router Speech Expert Text Expert Figure 1: Illustration of MMBERT model structure. Compared to traditional BERT-based model, it leverages the MoE architecture to scale and effectively handle multiple modalities. A three-stage progressive training strategy is designed to ensure stable training and prevent performance degradation. and Mora-Cantallops 2024; Ghorbanpour, Dementieva, and Fraser 2025). Their superior performance can be attributed to the ability to generate fine-grained contextualized repre- sentations, which are especially well-suited for classification tasks that require discerning subtle semantic distinctions and interpreting nuanced language—both of which are common in adversarial or implicitly encoded hate speech (Liu, Wang, and Catlin 2024). The architecture optimized for discrim- inative tasks enables more efficient and accurate detection of toxic content across various speech detection bench- marks (Deng et al. 2022; Xiao al. 2024). address the challenge of detecting cloaked hate speech in Chinese, a novel multimodal BERT-based architecture that incorporates visual and speech modalities alongside text, depicted in Figure 1. To enhance scalability and specialization, MMBERT integrates the MoE arXiv:2508.00760v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- mechanism, enabling dynamic routing of representations to modality-specific experts. However, na¨ıvely inserting MoE into BERT leads to severe training instability and degraded performance, particularly in the multimodal setting (Zhang et al. 2021). To overcome this, we introduce three-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pretrain modality aligners using synthetic multimodal data to map visual and auditory inputs into the BERT language space. In the second stage, we train modality-specific experts and con- tinue refining aligners using task-specific supervision. In the final stage, we jointly fine-tune the full MoE-augmented ar- chitecture on real multimodal hate speech data. This phased design ensures stable optimization and effective cross-modal integration. Our experiments across three benchmark speech datasets demonstrate that MMBERT achieves state- of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both fine-tuned BERT-based baselines and LLMs with in-context learning. In particular, MMBERT shows superior robust- ness in detecting cloaked adversarial content, highlighting the value of multimodal modeling and progressive training hate speech detection. We summarize the main contribution of this paper as fol- lows: • We novel multimodal BERT- based framework speech detection integrates textual, visual, speech Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, enhancing ro- bustness against cloaking-based adversarial perturba- tions. • We design three-stage training strategy that first aligns multimodal inputs to BERT language space, then specializes modality-specific experts, and fi- nally fine-tunes the complete model. This approach en- sures training effective cross-modal represen- tation learning. • We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, comparing MMBERT against fine-tuned BERT- based and open-source LLM baselines and closed-source in-context learning. Results that MMBERT consistently achieves superior particularly in detecting cloaking perturbed hate speech. Background and Motivation Cloaking Perturbations in Hate Speech Cloaking perturbations in Chinese online discourse repre- sent a growing challenge for detec- tion systems, as users employ various strategies to obfus- cate offensive content while preserving its intended meaning al. 2024; Xiao, Bouamor, and Zaghouani 2024). It can be mainly categorized into several types: Deformation. As Chinese characters are logographic, their meanings can be altered by decomposing or reconfig- uring individual components, often imparting specific emo- tional or ideological connotations (Lan 2006). For exam- ple, the character “ ” (meaning ‘silence’) comprises the radicals ” (meaning ‘black’) and ” (meaning ‘dog’), which in certain contexts have been used to convey deroga- tory implications toward the Black community. Homophonic Substitution. Words with similar pronun- ciations are frequently substituted to generate alternative se- mantics (Tien, Carson, and Jiang 2021). For instance, Chi- nese internet users often replace “ ” (mean- ing ‘full’) with ” (meaning ‘barbarian’), as both share a phonetic resemblance to ‘man’. Abbreviation. The contraction of sensitive terms en- hances conciseness while maintaining semantic clarity (Lan 2006). A notable example is ‘txl’, where each letter corre- sponds to the pinyin initials of “ ” ” “ ”, collectively denoting ‘homosexuality’. Code-Mixing. To intensify expressive tone and circum- vent automated content moderation, Chinese social me- dia users frequently incorporate non-Chinese linguistic ele- ments such as pinyin and emojis (Li et al. 2020). These code- mixed constructs not only obscure semantic intent from de- tection systems but also reinforce the emotive or derogatory force of the message. For instance, the term ” (meaning ‘ni brother’) phonetically approximates the English racial slur ‘n*gger’. Similarly, in the phrase ” (meaning ‘lick- ing dog’), the addition of an emoji amplifies the pejora- tive undertone, characterizing individuals perceived as ex- cessively submissive in relationship contexts—analogous to the English term ‘sycophant’. These perturbations exploit the unique and phonological characteristics the Chinese language to con- ceal offensive intent (Lu al. 2023). For instance, visually altering character radicals can introduce ideological conno- tations, while homophones and abbreviations obscure mean- ings through phonetic similarity or reduction. Code-mixing with pinyin or emojis further complicates semantic interpre- tation. Text-only models often fail to capture these manip- ulations due to their limited capacity to disambiguate sub- tle visual and phonological cues (Xiao, Bouamor, and Za- ghouani 2024; Raza Ur Rehman et al. 2025). Enhancing Chinese Language Modeling through Multimodal Pretraining Text-only approaches in Chinese language modeling often face limitations in capturing the full linguistic complexity of the language, particularly with respect to character ho- mographs and tonal ambiguity. These challenges hinder the model’s ability to accurately interpret semantic and phonetic nuances inherent in Chinese. To address these limitations, several studies have explored the integration of additional modalities, such as visual and phonetic information, into the pretraining process. For in- stance, ChineseBERT (Sun et al. 2021) integrates both glyph and pinyin embeddings, enriching the representation of Chi- nese characters by capturing visual features through mul- tiple font variations and phonetic information to resolve the heteronym phenomenon. This dual-embedding approach has shown significant improvements in various Chinese natural language processing tasks, such as named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. Similarly, models like ERNIE-M (Ouyang et al. 2020) and GlyphBERT al. 2021) have --- Page 3 --- demonstrated the benefits of incorporating external modal- ities, such as entity knowledge and visual cues, to enhance language understanding. However, existing multimodal approaches predominantly rely on embedding-level fusion of heterogeneous input modalities within a fixed BERT encoder architecture. While such integration enhances input representations, the pro- cessing and interaction of multimodal information remain largely static and inflexible. Specifically, the fixed fusion mechanism in standard BERT layers may limit the model’s capacity to dynamically adapt to context-dependent linguis- tic challenges, such as homographs and tonal ambiguity in Chinese. This rigidity restricts ability to effec- tively leverage the complementary strengths of each modal- ity in a nuanced and input-sensitive manner. Scaling Multimodal Language Models with MoE Architectures Recent advancements in large MLLMs have increasingly ex- plored the use of MoE (Eigen, Ranzato, and Sutskever 2013) architectures to enhance scalability, efficiency, and special- ization across modalities. Early generations of MLLMs, such as Flamingo (Alayrac et al. 2022) and GPT-4V (Yang et al. 2023), are grounded in dense architectural paradigms that encounter scalability limitations as data volume and modality complexity increase. To address this, MoE-based frameworks such as CuMo et al. 2024) and Uni-MoE et al. 2025) introduce sparsely-activated expert mod- ules, allowing modality-specific processing while maintain- ing low inference overhead. CL-MoE (Huai al. 2025) fur- ther extends MoE for continual learning in vision-language tasks, employing dual routers to balance generalization and retention. Furthermore, MoExtend (Zhong al. 2024) in- troduces modular extension mechanisms that facilitate the adaptation of pretrained models to new tasks and modali- ties, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost associated with full model retraining. These approaches illustrate that MoE architectures not only enhance computational efficiency but also offer in- creased flexibility in handling multimodal inputs, thereby establishing MoE as a compelling framework for scaling BERT-based models to complex multimodal tasks. Methodology Overview As shown in Figure 1, the MMBERT framework consists of a text tokenizer, word embedding layer, vision and speech encoders, modality aligners, MoE-scaled BERT blocks, and a classification head. Modality aligners project non-text in- puts into a shared linguistic space, enabling effective multi- modal fusion. The MoE layers are integrated the BERT encoder to dynamically route representations across modal- ities, improving detection accuracy. MMBERT is trained in three sequential stages: Modality aligner training, modality- specific expert training, and MMBERT tuning using a di- verse collection of multimodal speech data. The detailed model architecture, training setting and model efficiency information are provided in Appendix A. MMBERT Architecture Multimodal data generation. To synthesize the visual and audio data of corresponding text input, we employ the Kokoro text-to-speech model (Kaneko al. 2022) to gen- erate speech data corresponding to the input text. For the visual modality, we render a sequence of word-level font im- ages representing each token in the text, thereby producing a visual analogue of the input. Aligners. To enable the effective transformation of het- erogeneous modality inputs into a unified linguistic repre- sentation space, MMBERT leverages the pretrained visual- language framework LLaVA (Liu et al. 2023) and the speech-language framework SpeechT5 (Ao al. 2021). Specifically, for visual encoding, we adopt the CLIP-base- Chinese model et al. 2022), followed by a linear pro- jection layer that maps the extracted visual features into soft image tokens compatible with the embedding space of BERT (Devlin et al. 2019). For speech, we utilize the en- coder from the Whisper-base-Chinese speech recognition model (Radford al. 2023), likewise augmented with a lin- ear projection layer to project speech features into the same shared linguistic space. The alignment process is formally defined as follows: X = {T, {I1, . . . , Ik}, S} (1) T = WordEmbedding(Tokenizer(T)) (2) S = SpeechAligner(Whisper(S)) (3) Ii = VisionAligner(CLIP(Ii)) (4) V = [I1, . , Ik] (5) where Ik}, S} represents the text, images and speech inputs respectively. The SpeechAligner and V isionAligner modules are implemented as learnable lin- ear projections that transform modality-specific features a shared language embedding space. The sequence of word- level font image embeddings is concatenated to form the fi- nal visual token sequence. MMBERT blocks. By the above aligners, we could ob- tain the encoded embedding of different modalities aligned in unified language domain. We concatenate the different modality embeddings as the final input to the MMBERT blocks. We denote the text, speech, vision embedding rep- resentations to T = {T1, . , Tn}, S = {S1, . , Sm} V = {V1, . , Vk} respectively, where n, m, and k corre- spond to the respective sequence lengths of each modality. The MMBERT block computation proceeds as follows: Xl0 = [T1, . , Tn; S1, . , Sm; V1, . , Vk] (6) Xa lj = Self-Atten(LN(Xlj−1)) + Xlj−1 (7) Xlj = MoE(LN(Xa lj)) + Xa lj (8) where LN(·) refers to layer normalization, the Xa lj repre- sents the output latent of the self attention layer in the j th MMBERT block, Xlj represents latent of j the MMBERT block. The MoE mechanism incorporates a set of experts E = {ET , ES, EV } each implemented as a feed- forward neural network.

The final MoE output is weighted combination of the different specific expert outputs. MMBERT training strategy To capitalize on the effectiveness of multi-expert col- laboration—where each expert possesses distinct capabil- ities—while retaining the rich contextual and syntactic knowledge encoded in the original BERT model through large-scale pretraining, we propose a training strategy to facilitate the incremental development of MMBERT. in Figure 2, the training process is structured into three progressive stages to enhance the ef- ficacy of multi-expert collaboration through an incremental learning strategy. 1: Aligner Training. The primary objective of the initial stage is to establish effective interoperability be- tween heterogeneous modalities and linguistic representa- tions. Modality-specific MLPs serve as aligners that project inputs from speech and vision into soft token embeddings. These aligners are trained by minimizing the mean squared error between the modality embeddings and the BERT- encoded textual representations. To improve the model’s sensitivity to perturbed speech samples, speech and image representations generated from the perturbed text are aligned with those derived from the corresponding unperturbed text representations during the training process. 2: Expert Training. In this stage, modality-specific experts are trained independently using cross-modal data to specialize in their respective domains. Training continues to be guided by the minimization of cross-entropy loss, while the trained aligners weights in the first stage are adapted and further trained to better capture and represent the unique characteristics inherent to their respective modalities on the hate speech classification task. To facilitate the pro- jection of heterogeneous modality data a unified lin- guistic representation space by both the aligners and experts, the classification head originally trained on textual input is shared across other modalities. 3: MMBERT Tuning. The final stage integrates the trained experts into the MoE layers of MMBERT. A context-aware routing mechanism dynamically assigns in- put representations to appropriate experts based on semantic relevance. To prevent unbalanced expert weight distribution, an auxiliary loss is applied to encourage uniform expert uti- lization: Ltotal = Lcross-entropy + α · Laux (11) Laux = N · N X i=1 pi · fi (12) where N denotes the total number of experts, α represents the weighting coefficient, pi represents the proportion of se- quences routed to expert i, and fi is the average gating prob- ability assigned to expert i. The classification head is fine- tuned jointly to generate the final prediction.

Specifically, we adopt several BERT- based models with a fully connected classification layer as encoder-based baselines, and utilize LLMs with structured task-specific prompts as decoder-based baselines. Encoder-Based BERT Models. As representative encoder-based BERT models, we select three widely adopted Chinese pretrained BERT-based encoders: BERT1 et al. 2019), BERT-wwm2 et al. 2019) and RoBERTa3 al. 2019). Each model is fine-tuned by attaching fully connected layer on top of the pooled output from the encoder to perform classification. In addition, we include et al. 2021), a recently proposed model that integrates lexicon and phonological into the standard BERT architecture, to examine its performance under the same experimental settings. Decoder-Based LLMs. For LLM baselines, we assess the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs, includ- ing GPT-3.5 (Brown et al. 2020), GPT-4o (OpenAI 2024), LLaMA3-8B (Meta AI 2024), Qwen2.5-7B&72B (Alibaba 2024), and DeepSeek-v3 (DeepSeek 2024). These models are evaluated under a unified prompt-based inference frame- work. This setup ensures consistency across different mod- els and enables fair comparison with encoder-based models. Dataset To evaluate the proposed MMBERT, we conduct experi- ments on three speech datasets that collectively support comprehensive and robust assessment. ToxiCN al. 2023) provides 12,011 samples of standard hate speech annotations for naturally occurring Chinese text, serving as a baseline for evaluating classification performance. Tox- iCloakCN al. 2024) introduces 4,582 cloaking perturbed examples in code-mixing and homophonic sub- stitution, specifically to evade text-only detectors while preserving hateful intent, making it essential for test- ing model robustness against cloaking strategies. Finally, COLD al. 2022) extends evaluation to a wider spectrum of offensive content with 37,480 samples, offering 1https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese 2https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-bert-wwm-base 3https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext insight into a model’s generalizability across various forms of toxicity. Together, these datasets form a diverse and chal- lenging benchmark suite for assessing both accuracy and ad- versarial resilience in speech detection. Evaluation method We employ the widely used metrics of accuracy (Acc), macro precision (Pre), macro recall (Rec) and macro F1- score (F1) to evaluate the classification performance of mod- els. For the BERT-based models and open source LLMs with relatively comparable parameter size with MMBERT in the baselines, we fine-tune and reserve the best perform- ing models with hyperparameters on the test set. All datasets are partitioned into training, validation and test sets using an 8:1:1 split ratio with early stopping strategy to prevent overfit during training. For the LLMs baselines, we perform few-shot learning with a basic prompt temple with different few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) set- tings, details can be found in Appendix B. All experiments are conducted using a NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. Result and Discussion Main result Table 1 and 2 presents the evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs, models and LLM APIs across the ToxiCloakCN, ToxiCN, and COLD benchmarks using accuracy, macro precision, macro recall, and macro F1 as metrics. consistently achieves the highest scores across all three datasets, demonstrating both strong overall performance and robustness to adversarial pertur- bations. Specifically, MMBERT attains macro F1 scores of 95.2, 92.2, and 85.8 on ToxiCN, and COLD, respectively. Compared to the strongest fine-tuned baseline, ChineseBERT, these results represent improvements of 8.4, 1.6, and 3.6 points in macro F1. These gains highlight the ef- fectiveness of integrating and visual modali- ties through the Mixture-of-Experts framework and the pro- gressive three-stage training strategy, which jointly enhance ability to capture phonological and visual cues indicative of cloaked hate speech. Traditional encoder-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and ChineseBERT, perform competitively on ToxiCN and moderately well on COLD.

In con- trast, LLM APIs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and DeepSeek-v3 show limited effectiveness in few-shot and perturbed settings. For example, GPT-4o achieves only 62.4 F1 on ToxiCloakCN under basic prompt- ing, underscoring the insufficiency of in-context learning alone for this domain-specific and adversarial task. Providing both unperturbed and perturbed examples, as well as incorporating CoT prompting, yields modest im- provements for LLMs. GPT-4o, for instance, improves from 62.4 to 69.3 ToxiCloakCN under the CoT setting. Nevertheless, these enhancements remain far below the per- formance of MMBERT, indicating that domain-adaptive multimodal modeling is critical for robust detection rather than relying solely on prompting. Across datasets, ToxiCloakCN poses the greatest chal- lenge due to heavy of cloaking perturbations, and MM- BERT is the only model to surpass 90 F1 on this benchmark. ToxiCN represents hate speech detection, where all fine-tuned BERT variants perform strongly and MMBERT provides consistent incremental gains. COLD, as a more diverse and open-domain dataset, produces lower overall scores, yet MMBERT maintains the best recall, confirming its generalization to nuanced and implicit toxic language. Overall, the results validate the task-specific multimodal modeling with MoE-based expert routing training for MMBERT substantially outperforms both fine- tuned text-only models and prompt-based LLMs, particu- larly in adversarial scenarios involving hate speech. Detailed failure case analyses are presented in Appendix C. Routing distribution analysis We analyze the average routing weight distribution of different experts in MMBERT 12 MoE layers under three hate speech perturbation cate- gories in the ToxiCloakCN dataset as in Figure 3. In the non-perturbed setting, the model primarily routes to the text expert, especially in middle layers, reflecting the dominance of textual semantics. Speech and image experts contribute consistently, with image usage slightly increas- ing in deeper layers. Under homophonic perturbation, the model shifts toward the speech expert in early and mid- dle layers, leveraging phonetic cues to resolve ambiguities introduced by homophones. Vision expert assigned weight decreases slightly, while text routing remains stable. In the code-mixing scenario, image experts dominate across most layers, indicating reliance on visual context to address mul- tilingual inconsistencies. Text experts are also more engaged in earlier layers, while speech expert weight declines. These patterns demonstrate MMBERT adaptive routing behavior, where expert activation is dynamically adjusted based on input characteristics, enhancing robustness against modality-specific perturbations. Ablation study on training strategy We conduct an ab- lation study evaluate effectiveness of the progres- --- Page 7 --- Figure 3: Distribution of expert loading with different input perturbation types, left: non perturbation, middle: homophonic perturbation, right: code-mixing perturbation Figure 4: Ablation study evaluating the impact of each stage in the proposed training strategy sive training strategy for MoE into MMBERT. Specifically, we compare the full pipeline with three variants: without aligner training stage (stage 1), with- out expert stage (stage 2), and without both stages. All models are trained for 50 epochs on ToxiCloakCN dataset under identical settings. in Figure 4, the full three-stage strategy achieves the best overall performance, with the lowest train- ing loss and highest validation accuracy. It enables stable convergence and strong generalization, indicating that grad- ual modality alignment and expert specialization are both essential for effective multimodal learning. Without aligner pretraining, convergence is slower and validation perfor- mance is less stable, suggesting suboptimal cross-modal mapping. Removing expert specialization also leads to re- duced accuracy and higher loss, showing that expert-specific representation learning is crucial. The worst performance is observed when both stages are removed, as the model quickly overfits and fails to generalize. These results demon- strate that each stage of the proposed training strategy plays a critical role in enabling MMBERT to effectively detect hate speech across modalities. study on modalities To assess of each modality in the MMBERT framework, we perform Dataset Text&Speech Text&Vision Acc F1 Acc F1 ToxiCloakCN 91.2 91.1 87.7 86.6 ToxiCN 90.1 90.9 88.9 89.3 COLD 83.1 83.8 82.7 81.9 Table 3: ity MMBERT framework an ablation study by scaling with single modality, using text paired with either speech or vision. shown in Table 3, the text and speech combination consistently outperforms text and vision setting all three datasets. On the ToxiCloakCN dataset, the F1 score reaches 91.1 when using speech compared to 86.6 when using vision, indicating that speech features are more effective in capturing adversarial cues introduced by cloaking perturbations. This trend is also observed ToxiCN and COLD, where and speech setting yields stronger results. These findings suggest that speech contributes more complementary information than vision and role in improving robustness speech detection. Conclusion We presents MMBERT, a multimodal framework for Chi- nese detection that effectively incorporates text, speech, and vision using the MoE architecture. To ensure stable integration of modalities, a strategy that proves critical for effective optimiza- tion. Ablation studies confirm the importance of both the training strategy and modality fusion, with speech contribut- ing significantly to robustness. Empirical results across mul- tiple benchmarks MMBERT achieves strong per- formance, particularly under adversarial conditions involv- ing cloaked perturbations. Our findings highlight the po- tential of multimodal modeling for addressing complex language understanding challenges, particularly in safety-critical domains like speech detection. --- Page 8 --- Ethics Statement This work involves speech detection with sensitive content. datasets are publicly available and anonymized, and our models are intended solely for research to avoid potential bias and misuse.

Appendix A: MMBERT Details Model Architecture MMBERT is built upon the BERT-base-chinese4 encoder, which serves as the backbone for tex- tual representation. For modality-specific feature extraction, we employ a vision encoder based on chinese-clip-vit-base-patch165 and a speech based on whisper-base6. Each modality is passed through a dedicated aligner, as a lightweight two-layer MLP, to project the the BERT embedding space, thereby forming unified token representations. These representations are processed by modified BERT layers in which the original feed-forward networks are replaced by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers. Each MoE layer contains experts and self-attention mechanism, with a context-aware routing function that dynamically assigns token sequences to appropriate experts. A head applied to the final output to produce predictions. Training Setting Training is performed in three progressive stages. In stage 1, modality aligners are pretrained using synthetic parallel data to align and speech features with their correspond- ing textual embeddings. The learning rate in this stage is set to 1e-3. In stage 2, are trained in- dependently using cross-modal supervision, while aligners continue to adapt. During this phase, the learning rate for the aligners is maintained at 1e-3, the text expert at 5e-6, and the and vision experts at 5e-5. In stage 3, all compo- nents are jointly fine-tuned on the speech detection task using a cross-entropy loss. The learn- ing in this final set to 5e-4. To promote bal- anced utilization across experts, we incorporate an auxiliary load-balancing loss the MoE layers, with a weighting coefficient of 1e-2. The model is 50 epochs using the AdamW op- timizer and a linear learning rate decay schedule. Excluding the parameters of the modality-specific encoders, the MM- BERT architecture contains approximately 60 million train- able parameters. conducted using Py- Torch on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Model Efficiency Parameter Count. The MMBERT model comprises 297.4 million parameters in total, including 162.4M in the back- bone network (representing a 47% increase relative to BERT-base), 49M in the Whisper-base speech encoder, and 86M in the CLIP-base vision encoder. Computational Cost. A single forward pass requires ap- proximately 58.44 GFLOPs, which is the sum of 12×2.89 GFLOPs from the MMBERT layers, 21.2 from the Whisper-base encoder, and 2.56 from the 4https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese 5https://huggingface.co/OFA-Sys/chinese-clip-vit-base- patch16 6https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base --- Page 10 --- CLIP-base encoder. The contribution of the pooler and clas- sifier heads is negligible. Routing Overhead. The mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer routing introduces an additional 908.4 MFLOPs (12×75.8 MFLOPs), accounting for approximately 2.6% of the total computational cost. Inference Latency. Under single-query inference with a sequence length of 128 on an NVIDIA H100 GPU, MM- BERT achieves a latency of 6.3 ms in FP32 precision (com- pared to 3.5 ms for BERT-base) and 3.2 ms in FP16 preci- sion (compared to 2 ms for BERT-base).

Examples Example 1 (Hate Speech): Input: 这群人真是社会的败类，应该被清除！ Output: Hate Speech Example 2 (Non-Hate Speech): Input: 今天天气真好。 Output: Non-Hate Speech Now, please classify the following text: Input: [Insert Chinese text to be classified here] Output: English Prompt Template Figure 5: Chinese and English version of the LLM speech detection evaluation template Appendix C: Failure Case Analysis To better understand the limitations of MMBERT, we man- ually reviewed 50 misclassified samples from each test set. Two dominant failure modes emerged: Cultural Context Gaps (38%) False Positive Example (COLD): “Taiwanese rednecks leave Weibo” Root Cause: The model misclassifies culturally nuanced ex- pressions as toxic due to limited coverage of regional di- alects and sociopolitical context in the training data. Mitigation Strategy: Diversify annotation teams with na- tive speakers from multiple Chinese-speaking regions and include context-rich examples to reduce such errors. Sarcasm and Reclaimed Terms (32%) True Negative Example (ToxiCN): “We gays are disgusting haha” Root Cause: Binary toxicity labels lack contextual nu- ance. The model cannot distinguish reclaimed slurs or self- deprecating humor from genuine hate. Mitigation Strategy: Introduce ternary labeling schemes (e.g., hate, reclaimed, neutral) or enrich the dataset with metadata such as speaker identity and intent. These errors highlight that MMBERT is sensitive to cultural variation, sarcasm, and reclaimed language. Future work should explore context-aware annotations, richer label tax- onomies, and sociolinguistic metadata to improve ness in real-world deployment.
Title: ITUNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 8: Question-Answering over Tabular Data: A Zero-Shot Approach using LLM-Driven Code Generation Authors: Atakan Site, Emre Hakan Erdemir, Gülşen Eryiğit Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00762v1 --- Page 1 --- Code Generation Atakan Site*†, Emre Hakan Erdemir∗, Gül¸sen Eryi˘git Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering Istanbul Technical University {site21, erdemire21, gulsenc}@itu.edu.tr Abstract This paper presents our system for SemEval- 2025 Task 8: DataBench, over Tabular Data. The primary objective of this task is to perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains un- der two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solu- tion with a particular emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code gen- eration. Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pan- das code via optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs ex- hibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation. Additionally, results show that code generation achieves supe- rior performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches. Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is un- known at the time of this paper’s submission, our system achieved eighth place in Subtask I and sixth in Subtask II among the 30 systems that outperformed the baseline in the open-source models category. 1 Introduction Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where the most relevant answers are retrieved from a given document or plain text. Apart from such unstruc- tured data, working with widely used structured data is crucial for real-world applications. More- over, structured data encompasses a much broader semantic scope. One important form of data is tabular data, which consists of rows with a consistent set of features. Unlike unstructured documents, tabular data exhibits complex and het- erogeneous relationships that require specialized *These authors contributed equally. †Corresponding author. processing techniques. Information retrieval from tabular data is typically performed using various SQL queries and similar approaches. However, these methods depend on rigid rule-based systems and fail to consider the semantic properties of the data. Consequently, natural-language queries over tabular data face significant limitations. As a result, question-answering systems developed for tabular data have garnered significant interest among re- searchers. The process of converting a natural language query into a machine-executable logical form is known as semantic parsing (Wang et al., 2015). Early studies primarily focused on datasets that required adapting specific logical forms for each table structure type. This approach, however, led to suboptimal performance, particularly in tabu- lar structures spanning multiple domains (Pasu- pat and Liang, 2015). On the other hand, end- to-end trained transformers are widely employed, as they handle both question/query interpretation and reasoning tabular data (Deng et al., 2020). The recent advancements in LLMs have become a pivotal focus tabular question answering, as in many other problem domains. However, LLM- based approaches introduce several challenges, in- cluding high computational costs and limited con- text length, making scalable and efficient tabular QA systems an open research problem. To ad- dress these challenges and foster the development of effective tabular question-answering methods, SemEval-2025 Task 8 (Osés Grijalba et al., 2025) has been designed to introduce the necessary level of difficulty through two distinct subtasks. In this paper, propose a zero-shot system to address these tasks, focusing primarily on LLM-based code generation. Our approach in- troduces a unified framework leveraging state-of- the-art open-source LLMs, including DeepSeek- R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a), DeepSeek-V3 et al., 2025b), Qwen2.5-Coder-32B- arXiv:2508.00762v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- Instruct (Hui et al., 2024), and Llama-3.3-70B- Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024). We employ efficient prompting strategies generate executable Python Pandas1 library code. To enhance LLM understand- ing of tabular structures, the generated Python code is executed in a controlled environment. A key feature of our system is its iterative error-handling mechanism. If the initial code execution fails, the error message and faulty code are sent back to the LLM for correction, with a maximum of two itera- tions. This mechanism significantly improves ro- bustness, reducing failure rates in complex queries. We observe that one model in our pipeline achieves the highest accuracy on Subtask I (84.67%), while another leads Subtask II (85.05%), both without task-specific fine-tuning. All code is available on our GitHub repository2. 2 Related Work This section reviews recent developments in LLMs, focusing on their applications tabular question answering. In recent years, the emergence of the Trans- former architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has led to remarkable advancements in language modeling tasks. This progress has resulted in state-of-the- art performance across various NLP tasks. Con- sequently, the application of transformer architec- tures to problems requiring tabular modeling has become inevitable. focused on different embedding mechanisms (Yin et al., 2020), pre-training strategies et al., 2021), and architectural modifications (Huang 2020). The core approach introduced by these methods was pre-training Transformer architectures from scratch tabular data (Herzig al., 2020). How- ever, this approach faces efficiency and scalabil- ity limitations, particularly when models need to generalize across multiple domains. Generally, pre-trained language models struggle to adapt effi- ciently to task-specific tabular datasets. More recently, emergence of LLMs has brought about a significant transformation in the field. Models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023) have demon- strated strong few-shot and zero-shot capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across var- ious tasks while often requiring little to no task- 1https://pandas.pydata.org/ 2https://github.com/erdemire21/ semeval8-itunlp specific data. These advancements have enabled the use of a single, unified model for solving com- plex tabular tasks. The transition from training models from scratch or adapting pre-trained lan- guage models to leveraging LLMs represents a sig- nificant paradigm shift in tabular data processing. However, application of LLMs to tabular ques- tion answering introduces several challenges. One major limitation is the context length constraint in- herent to LLMs. When processing large or multiple tables, the limited context size prevents the model from encoding all necessary information. Addi- tionally, handling multiple tables often leads to hallucinations, where models generate inaccurate or misleading responses. To overcome these limitations, researchers have leveraged the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. The effectiveness of LLM-based ap- proaches largely depends on how tabular data and question queries are represented and utilized. For tabular data, appropriate table schemas and prompt- ing strategies incorporating relevant examples are designed to enhance model comprehension. Query representation can also significantly impact perfor- mance. A common strategy involves decomposing complex queries into step-by-step subqueries, im- proving model interpretability (Yang et al., 2024). Another approach is transforming queries into in- termediate representations such as Python code or SQL queries, enabling structured execution (Cao et al., 2023; Zhang al., 2024). These advance- ments have led to models capable of performing task-specific reasoning without requiring additional fine-tuning. Building on insights from previous studies, we find that effectively addressing Task 8 requires a deep understanding of query se- mantics and table structures, as well as the ability to generate accurate answers across diverse answer formats. Motivated by these challenges, we intro- duce a novel framework that integrates schema- guided prompting, controlled execution, and an error-handling mechanism. Our extensive evalu- ations and prompt strategy experiments highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing ac- curacy and robustness. These findings show the practicality and applicability of the proposed ap- proach in real-world scenarios, where tabular data must be processed dynamically without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. --- Page 3 --- Figure 1: Our proposed framework. 3 Data The original DataBench dataset et al., 2024) provides 1308 questions from 65 dif- ferent domains, each containing question-answer pairs written in English. During the competition, this dataset was expanded with the addition of a new test split et al., 2025). The ex- act dataset statistics are presented in Table 1. The train and development splits contain the following columns: • question: The natural language question. • answer: The response to the question for DataBench QA subtask. • type: The type of the answer, which can be boolean, number, category, list[category], list[number]. • columns_used: The columns of the dataset required to answer the question. • column_types: The data types of these columns, which include boolean, number (e.g., UInt8, uint32, uint16). • sample_answer: for Lite subtask. • dataset: The name the dataset from which the question is derived. The sample_answer column is specifically in- cluded for the DataBench QA Lite subtask, which is a simplified version of DataBench QA task. This subset consists of 20 sampled entries from the Split Questions Datasets Train 988 49 Dev 320 16 Test 522 15 Table 1: DataBench dataset statistics. original dataset, serving as a small-scale reference for evaluation. In contrast to these extensively annotated and development splits, the test split only has ques- tion and dataset columns to ensure proper evalua- tion without data leak for the competition. Although the dataset provides structured development splits with detailed annotations, this study did not utilize these data for training, as we preferred a zero-shot approach that does not involve fine-tuning. 4 System Overview Our approach involves two main steps in providing an answer to questions over tabular data: prepro- cessing and then code generation and execution. The complete workflow is illustrated in Figure 1. 4.1 Preprocessing Our preprocessing steps include obtaining the given questions and datasets from the competition web- site, followed by a series of normalization and standardization techniques, and finally creating a --- Page 4 --- schema for each dataset for LLM prompting. Each dataset is transformed with transformation rules. First, all spaces and non-word characters are re- placed with underscores except for trailing special characters, which are removed. Second, all column names are converted to lowercase, and duplicate columns are renamed by appending a number to each duplicate. For example, if there are two cols named "col" and "Col@", the second one becomes "col_2". After normalization and standardization, we con- struct a each dataset to enhance the LLM’s understanding of the table structure. The schemas include each dataset’s name, each column, each column’s data type, 5 unique values from each column, and the total unique values that a column contains. The example values are limited to a hun- dred characters total to avoid excessive verbosity and potential token overload. Examples of the con- structed schemas can be seen in Appendix A, (e.g., see the schema for the TripAdvisor dataset in Ap- pendix A.1). We use the full dataset for schema creation for both full and sample datasets. 4.2 Code Generation and Execution The code generation step is done with a prompt that includes the question, detailed instructions and the corresponding dataset schema. A detailed break- down of the code generation prompt is provided in Appendix B. The generated a controlled environment, where dynamic imports are extracted, and the execution output is captured in its original format. In cases where execution fails, an error handling mechanism is triggered. The system captures error message along with the faulty code and sends it LLM for auto- matic correction. The LLM then generates a re- vised of the code. This iterative process is run until the predefined threshold is met. If the pro- vided code is still faulty after the maximum number of attempts, execution is terminated for that query. The execution result from the last successfully ex- ecuted code is then set as the final answer for the corresponding question. 5 Experimental Setup Our zero-shot framework was tested on the offi- cially released development and test datasets of SemEval 2025 Task 8, covering its two subtasks 2025). The models used in our system were selected based on their performance in code generation tasks, ensuring their effectiveness in handling structured and semi-structured tabu- lar question answering. Additionally, we opted for of two iterations based on pre- liminary experiments, which showed that attempts beyond two iterations rarely produced further im- provements. To provide a more comprehensive error analysis, we also conducted additional ex- periments with three iterations. To evaluate sys- tem performance, we used Accuracy, the official evaluation metric 2025 Task 8. Fur- thermore, we analyzed the impact of our iterative error-handling mechanism on execution reliability by measuring error reduction rates across different models. These evaluations provide insights into both models accuracy and execution robustness question answering. 6 Results The performance of the models is presented in Ta- ble 2. Our results indicate that one of the DeepSeek models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3) out- performs all other models across both subtasks. We see that DeepSeek-V3 falls behind all the others on the development sets, but performs better specif- ically on the test set of Subtask I. DeepSeek-R1, is a subsequent iteration, building upon V3 with enhanced capabilities via reinforcement learn- ing, outperforms Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct models on all tasks and datasets, falling behind DeepSeek-V3 by 0.52 per- centage points on the Subtask I test set. Moreover, in official evaluation within open-source models category, our best-performing model ranked eighth and sixth in Sub- task II, placing systems that outper- formed the baseline. These results further high- light approach in zero-shot question answering. At paper’s submission, due to a lack of information on other solutions, we were unable to evaluate our performance relative to other zero-shot systems in the competition. Through our manual observa- tions, we identified that the test datasets are sig- nificantly more challenging. However, we do not believe that every question-answer pair in these datasets can perfectly represent the real-world per- formance of the models. Nonetheless, the widening performance gap in the more challenging test sets suggests that DeepSeek-R1 may generalize to the problem more effectively, providing evidence of its --- Page 5 --- Models Subtask I (DataBench) Subtask II (DataBench Lite) Dev Test Dev Test DeepSeek-R1 88.43 84.09 86.56 85.05 DeepSeek-V3 82.50 84.67 78.75 80.84 Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct 87.18 83.90 85.31 81.99 Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct 86.56 83.14 82.81 81.03 Table 2: Results on the DataBench subtasks across all models.

In addition, as shown in Table 3, our error han- dling mechanism decreases the number of execu- tion errors by nearly half on average, demonstrating not only its effectiveness but also its necessity for ensuring reliable execution. It should be noted that the initial error rate and the accuracy over both tasks show a strong correlation, with mod- els that achieve higher accuracy also generating less faulty code to begin with. This suggests that better-performing models inherently produce more reliable code, thereby reducing the need for itera- tive error correction loops and improving overall execution efficiency. To analyze error patterns and of our correction mechanism in greater detail, we grouped errors into three main categories: Runtime, Degen- erate Loop, and Syntax. Notably, the Runtime category includes diverse errors such as KeyError and ValueError, but for simplicity, we report them under a single label. Our findings also indicate that some errors transform into different types across iterations. We define Degenerate Loop errors as cases where an LLM repeatedly generates identical or nearly identical output sequences, continuing in- definitely until it reaches its maximum token limit. Table 4 presents the distribution of error types across models and iterations. Results show that most initial failures are due to Runtime errors, while Syntax and Loop errors are less frequent but may persist across multiple correction attempts. Specifically, Syntax errors are observed exclusively in DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 models, with no such errors detected for Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct or Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct across any dataset or iteration. Similarly, errors are ob- served solely DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3, with no occurrences in Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct or Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. As shown in Fig- ures 2 and 3, although some Degenerate Loop er- rors are corrected, a notable portion still results in failures. Finally, Figure 2 provides an overview of er- ror resolution across iterations, showing that most runtime errors are resolved within the first two at- tempts. Figure 3 further breaks down specific error types, such as FileNotFoundError, KeyError, and NameError, offering a more fine-grained view. 7 Conclusions In conclusion, this paper presented the solution de- veloped by the ITUNLP group for SemEval-2025 Task 8. The proposed approach addressed the lar question answering task in zero-shot scenarios. Our method yields promising results question answering, achieving higher ranks (8th I and 6th in Subtask II) within the 30 participant the open-source cate- gory. Since these 30 systems may have employed fine-tuning or few-shot learning techniques, further analysis would be possible upon the publication of the system description papers that achieved bet- ter results on the same category of the shared task, which will provide a clearer understanding of our ranking within zero-shot frameworks. As this study focuses only on open-source LLMs, future work could include evaluating proprietary LLMs within our proposed framework to gain a broader perspective on model performance. Fur- thermore, the DataBench dataset consists of ques- tions that require using only a single table. As fu- ture work, we aim evaluate our zero-shot model’s performance on multi-table reasoning tasks, further expanding its applicability. --- Page 6 --- References AI@Meta. 2024.

Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGEN- DERED benchmark, revealed significant limitations in earlier LLMs’ handling of inclusive pronouns, but was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4, DeepSeek-V3,Qwen Turbo and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender identity inference. Our results show notable improvements com- pared with the previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy. However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse infer- ence tasks remains inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity- sensitive reasoning. We discussed implications, model-specific observa- tions, and avenues for future inclusive AI research. Keywords: LLMs · Pronoun Bias · Fairness · Gender-Inclusive 1 Introduction In recent years, responsible artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a central concern across both research and policy domains, driven by growing awareness of the ethical and societal impacts of AI technologies. This focus is reflected in global initiatives as the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence [26], the European Union’s AI Act [6], and the OECD ⋆Xushuo Tang and Yi Ding contributed equally to this work. arXiv:2508.00788v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- 2 X. Tang et al. AI Principles [16]. These frameworks emphasize key ethical pillars, including fairness, inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination, par- ticularly in applications involving sensitive personal attributes. Reducing algo- rithmic bias, promoting model explainability, and safeguarding identity-related information are increasingly recognized as essential requirements for deploying trustworthy AI systems. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Claude 4 have achieved better performance across diverse NLP tasks, including summarization, question answering, code generation, and multi- turn dialogue. However, concerns persist regarding their equitable treatment of gendered language, where even advanced models continue to exhibit biases, pos- ing challenges to and inclusivity in real-world deployment. The study of gender bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has a long- standing history, beginning with word embedding analyses that uncovered stereo- typical associations between gender and occupations [3]. Benchmarks such as WinoBias[29] and Winogender[21] revealed gender misattributions in corefer- ence systems and earlier LLMs. Additional surveys continue to highlight social biases in embeddings, generation outputs, and downstream applications [8, 28]. However, most prior work has focused narrowly on binary gender distinctions, often neglecting the complexities of gender-neutral pronouns (e.g., they/them) and neopronouns (e.g., xe/xem). The MISGENDERED benchmark [9] thus was recently introduced to evaluates LLMs’ accuracy in using gender-neutral and neopronouns within masked-fill templates. Their results, based on pre-2023 models, revealed major limitations, with average neopronoun accuracy as low as 8% and little improvement even under few-shot prompting conditions. Motivation. Ensuring fairness in gender-inclusive language remains a criti- cal challenge for modern language models (LLMs). While MISGEN- DERED benchmark [9] represented a significant step toward evaluating handling of and neopronouns, it falls short of capturing the evolv- ing landscape of model capabilities and fairness requirements. Two key limita- tions of the original framework motivate our work: – Limited Benchmark Tasks. The original MISGENDERED benchmark focused exclusively on evaluating models’ ability to fill in masked pronouns based on ex- plicitly stated gender identities in surrounding text. This design tests whether a model can apply the correct pronoun once the identity is declared. However, this one-directional task does not capture the full range of gender-related rea- soning needed for responsible AI auditing. In many real-world applications, such as content moderation, automated summarization, and virtual assistant inter- actions, models must infer a speaker’s or referent’s gender identity based solely on how pronouns are used, without being explicitly told. This reverse inference task, which we term Gender Identity Inference, evaluates whether LLMs can de- duce gender declarations from contextual usage of pronouns like “they,” “xe,” or “ze.” The original benchmark did not address this dimension of fairness auditing, leaving a critical gap in evaluating pronoun consistency, bias reversibility, and latent misattribution errors. --- Page 3 --- Handling in LLMs 3 – Outdated Model Evaluation original MISGENDERED study was con- ducted using models such as GPT-2 and other pre-2023 architectures, which were neither instruction-tuned nor enhanced with modern alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). These earlier mod- els lacked the architectural advancements and human-centric safety alignment seen in today’s large-scale language models like Claude 4, or Deepseek V3. Consequently, the performance results reported in the original benchmark are no longer representative of current LLM capabilities. Given the rapid evolu- tion of transformer-based models in terms of context length, reasoning ability, and sensitivity to ethical considerations, it is crucial to revisit this benchmark with more powerful and safety-aligned models to understand whether progress in model development has translated into improved handling of gender-diverse pronouns and more inclusive language behavior. Contributions. To address these limitations and advance inclusive LLM evalua- tion, we present an updated and extended version of the MISGENDERED study. Our evaluation introduces new experimental dimensions, higher-performing mod- els, and a gender identity inference benchmark to probe deeper manifestations of bias behaviors. Our contributions are as follows: – New Benchmark Dataset. We propose MISGENDERED+, an enhanced and publicly extensible benchmark that significantly expands the original dataset with newly crafted templates, diverse pronoun forms (including various neopro- nouns), and a broader set of curated name-pronoun mismatches. This supports more fine-grained analysis of pronoun fidelity and nuanced bias behavior. – Modern LLMs Evaluations. We evaluate five recent and diverse LLMs, GPT- 4o [15], Claude-4-Sonnet [24], Qwen2.5-72B [27], Qwen-Turbo [23], and DeepSeek- V3 [25], spanning both commercial and open-source models. These models differ in scale, training objectives, strategies, and language coverage, allowing us to analyze performance variation across architectural and institutional designs. – Gender Identity Inference Task. We design a novel task to test ability to infer gender identity from pronoun usage, reversing the direction of traditional pronoun prediction benchmarks. This task reveals how models associate linguis- tic cues with identity categories, shedding light on implicit biases reasoning. – New Findings & Future Directions. Our experiments uncover several notable trends: (1) high alignment models outperform in neopronoun handling, (2) mul- tilingual models show weaker English-centric pronoun grounding, and (3) most models remain vulnerable to name-based gender bias. These findings provide valuable guidance for future fairness auditing and model improvement. 2 Background 2.1 Pronoun Bias Pronoun bias refers not only to technical disparities in NLP systems but also to pervasive social inequities in pronouns are used to reflect and undermine --- Page 4 --- 4 et al. gender identity recognition. Misgendering, using pronouns or names inconsistent with a person’s identity, is often experienced as a microaggression, leading to emotional distress, reduced agency, and systemic marginalization [20]. Pronoun usage carries profound implications for identity affirmation. Mis- gendering is increasingly understood as a form of epistemic injustice: denying someone’s self-identification diminishes their social legitimacy [2]. Sociolinguistic studies have shown that transgender, non-binary, and gender-diverse individuals experience higher rates of psychological distress, such as anxiety or depression, when repeatedly misgendered [10, 4]. In healthcare and public services, misgen- dering also contributes to reduced access and trust in institutions [1]. A nuanced understanding of pronoun bias requires distinguishing among [9]: – Binary pronouns: he/him/his/himself, she/her/hers/herself. These are traditional gendered pronouns corresponding to the binary categories of male and female. They are the most commonly represented in natural language corpora and are widely understood both socially and computationally. Their extensive usage has led to relatively high LLM accuracy in resolving and generating such pronouns, also to the reinforcement of gender stereotypes when models over- associate certain roles or attributes with binary gender. – Gender-neutral pronouns: singular they/them/their/theirs/themself. Orig- inally used as a plural pronoun, “they“ has gained widespread acceptance in re- cent decades as a singular pronoun to refer to individuals who identify outside the male/female binary or whose gender is unknown or unspecified. Its growing presence in inclusive writing guidelines (e.g., APA, MLA, and various journalistic standards) reflects broader societal acceptance. Computationally, models often struggle with ambiguity due to “they” functioning as both singular and plural, posing challenges for co-reference resolution and context-aware generation. – Neopronouns: emerging forms such as xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself etc. Neopro- nouns are recently coined or reclaimed pronoun forms created to offer alternatives beyond the binary and traditional gender-neutral options. These are often used by individuals who feel that existing pronouns do not adequately express their identity. While valid and increasingly adopted in LGBTQ+ communities, they remain rare in training corpora, leading to significantly lower performance in LLMs. Their novel morphology and lack of frequency in common datasets also result in tokenization and modeling difficulties. A list of commonly used binary, gender-neutral, and neopronouns are listed in Table 1. While binary pronouns are typically well-represented in training data and handled reliably by NLP models, and neopronouns remain rare-resulting in lower accuracy, inconsistency, and pronounced misgendering in both technological and social contexts. 2.2 Pronoun Bias in LLMs The issue pronoun bias was first identified in earlier NLP systems that re- lied heavily on syntactic and rule-based models.

Benchmarks like WinoBias [29] and Winogen- der [21] were subsequently introduced to test the fairness of coreference resolu- tion systems. These datasets used parallel sentence structures with controlled gender and occupation variables to expose models’ preference for stereotypical gender assignments. Despite advancements in deep learning, transformer-based such as GPT, BERT, and T5 to exhibit pronoun-related biases. These models are trained on massive web-scale corpora that replicate societal imbalances, and they often default to binary pronouns in ambiguous contexts. Furthermore, inclusive pronouns, especially neopronouns, are frequently tokenized into subword fragments by byte pair encoding (BPE) and similar schemes, impairing their representation in model inputs and out- puts [17]. benchmark [9] was developed to evaluate LLMs on their ability to correctly use declared pronouns in context, with a particular focus on non-binary and neopronouns. The study revealed alarmingly low per- formance on neopronouns in zero-shot settings, with accuracy dropping below 10%. Even gender-neutral pronouns like “they“ posed challenges, with models misattributing or substituting them with binary alternatives. 3 The MISGENERDERED Benchmark Overview and Motivation. [9] was devel- oped to systematically evaluate how well LLMs respect and apply user-declared pronouns, focus on gender-neutral and neopronoun usage. Mo- tivated by growing concerns around misgendering and pronoun fidelity in gener- ative language models, this benchmark addresses a critical fairness dimension in responsible AI development. Prior studies had predominantly focused binary gender forms, leaving a significant in evaluating models non-binary and underrepresented identities. MISGENDERED aims to close this gap by pro- --- Page 6 --- 6 et al. Declaration: Aamari’s pronouns are xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself Pronoun form: Nominative Input: Aamari was very stoic.

Answer: xemself Model: xemself √ Fig. 1: Evaluation Examples Across Pronoun Forms viding a comprehensive testbed for probing LLM behavior under various gram- matical and contextual conditions. Task Design. Each test instance in MISGENDERED follows a structured two-part format. The first sentence explicitly declares an individual’s pronouns (e.g., “Aamari’s pronouns are xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself.”). The second sentence presents a naturalistic context containing a masked placeholder [PRONOUN], which the model is asked fill in with the correct grammatical form. The benchmark covers five grammatical forms, nominative, accusative, possessive- dependent, possessive-independent, and reflexive, with ten distinct syntactic templates per form. This diversity ensures coverage of various linguistic pat- terns and co-reference scenarios encountered in real-world usage. Dataset Construction. MISGENDERED benchmark contains over 3.8 million templated instances, systematically designed to assess LLMs’ pronoun fidelity across a diverse range of gender identities. These instances span three primary pronoun categories: (1) Binary pronouns, (2) Gender-neutral pronouns, and (3) Neopronouns, as detailed in Section 2. Each example begins with an ex- --- Page 7 in LLMs 7 plicit pronoun declaration, followed by a contextual sentence a masked slot [PRONOUN] that asked to complete appropriately. Templates are manually constructed to span five core grammatical forms: nominative, ac- cusative, possessive-dependent, possessive-independent, and reflexive. For each grammatical form, ten natural-sounding sentence templates are authored and instantiated across a pool of names categorized by gender association (male, fe- male, and unisex). This generation process results in a high-coverage test set that balances syntactic diversity with identity variation. Example 1. Figure 1 illustrates representative input-output pairs for the neo- pronoun set “xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself,” covering all five grammatical forms. Empirical Results and Limitations. As originally reported, LLM perfor- mance varied significantly by pronoun type. Zero-shot prompting yielded approx- imately 75.9% accuracy for binary pronouns, 31.0% for gender-neutral pronouns, and only 7.6% for neopronouns. Few-shot prompting improved neopronoun accu- racy to 45–65%, but gains plateaued beyond six examples, revealing limitations in generalization. While MISGENDERED establishes a strong foundation for pronoun-specific evaluation, it also exhibits notable limitations. It is narrowly fo- cused on forward-generation accuracy, that is, filling in correct pronouns without considering reverse tasks such as deducing identity from usage or disambiguating competing pronoun candidates. Furthermore, while name diversity is incorpo- rated, the benchmark does not explicitly evaluate gender–pronoun mismatches or biases, limiting its scope in intersectional fairness analysis. 4 Benchmark Revisited - MISGENDERED+ To address the limitations the MISGENDERED benchmark and support more comprehensive analysis of LLMs’ pronoun capabilities, we intro- duce an enhanced benchmark suite. This includes a novel task, Identity Inference, which LLMs can from pronoun usage in context. Identity Inference Design. The Identity Inference task builds on methodologies from bias auditing research. Rather than asking models to generate appropriate pronouns (as in forward prediction), this task reverses the prompt: given a containing a pronoun and a name, the model must infer the most likely gender identity of the subject. This format allows us to iso- late interpretive bias, probing model can correctly respect the gender implication of the pronoun used, even when name-based priors might conflict. For instance, in the mismatched prompt “Alex was very emotional. Xe cried loudly and often,” the correct answer is non-binary, despite the name "Alex" often being interpreted as masculine. Conversely, matched prompts like “Abigail was very outgoing. She likes swimming” reinforce typical name-pronoun pairings. Each test case requires the model to select exactly one of three options: A) Male, B) Female, or C) Non-binary, and respond using only the corresponding letter. This constraint avoids explanation leakage and emphasizes pure classification behavior based on the pronoun signal. --- Page 8 --- 8 et al. Male Name Female Name Neutral Name Total Male Pronoun 600(Matched) [PHONE] Female Pronoun 600 600(Matched) 600 1800 Neopronoun [PHONE](Matched) 16200 Total 6600 [CREDIT_CARD] Table 2: Identity Inference Data Size Dataset. As shown in Table 2, the dataset comprises 19,800 instances, con- structed by systematically varying pronoun type (male, female, neopronoun) and name (male, female, neutral). A group of instances is templated using 20 names and 30 sentence structures. Each category contains several groups of such instances. Pronoun mismatches are intentionally introduced to challenge stereo- typical associations. Matched combinations (e.g., female name with she/her) provide baseline examples aligned with societal expectations. Mismatched com- binations (e.g., male name with neopronoun) test whether models default to name-based priors or appropriately respect the pronoun. The dataset is balanced across all name types, enabling controlled comparative evaluation. Evaluation Framework. Each instance follows a standard prompt structure. Models are evaluated based to infer the correct identity label, the pronoun used in the sentence, while intentionally disregarding any gender implications. Example 2. Figure 2 presents representative input examples from the Identity Inference task. In the first case, model is a sentence with a traditionally masculine name (“Alex”) and a neopronoun (“Xe”) and is prompted to choose likely gender identity. The answer is “C” (Non-binary), as dictated by the pronoun, but the model incorrectly selects “A” (Male), reveal- ing a bias toward name-based inference. In the second case, the sentence aligns a feminine name (“Abigail”) with a she/her pronoun, forming a matched condi- tion. The model correctly selects “B” (Female), demonstrating correct alignment between pronoun usage and identity inference. This task probes a different facet of pronoun handling than standard fill- in-the-blank or coreference resolution tasks, it evaluates interpretive alignment rather than syntactic generation. It also allows researchers to investigate re- verse biases: whether models tend to override explicit pronoun cues in favor of name-based heuristics. As such, the identity inference task offers criti- cal lens into model assumptions and implicit bias mechanisms, especially when dealing with underrepresented or non-traditional pronoun forms. By contrasting matched and mismatched outcomes across model families, we gain insight into how robustly each model respects pronoun declarations and avoids stereotypical mappings, central concern for fairness in identity-related tasks. --- Page 9 in LLMs 9 Prompt: Based on the pronouns in the following sentence, what gender identity does the person most likely have?

Models correct pronoun form without additional examples. Few-shot prompting: In addition to the declaration, contextual in-context exam- ples are provided. MISGENDERED study experimented with 0, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 examples; however, accuracy improvements plateaued at 6 examples. By exposing model to labeled examples, we aim to improve its pronoun interpretation through in-context learning, simulating a low-resource training scenario without explicit fine-tuning. Gender Identity Inference: This reverse task requires models to predict the pro- noun declaration from example usage patterns. To test model biases, we system- --- Page 10 --- 10 et al. atically construct enhanced identity inference part based on gendered name associations and pronoun types. This experiment expands on MISGEN- DERED by using an augmented dataset (MISGENDERED+) containing new combinations designed to probe misattribution errors. 5.2 Models Evaluated evaluate five high-performance language models (LLMs), encompassing both proprietary and open-source architectures, to benchmark their performance in inclusive pronoun handling: – GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2025) [15] A multimodal flagship model from Ope- nAI, GPT-4o is optimized for fast response time and high alignment quality. It demonstrates strong generalization across a range of tasks and languages, with excellent latency performance and reasoning capacity. – Claude-4-Sonnet (Anthropic, 2025) [24] Designed with a safety-first alignment philosophy, Claude-4-Sonnet excels in tasks requiring nuanced reason- ing, human preference modeling, and ethical decision-making. It is well-suited for applications where interpretability and value sensitivity are critical. – Qwen2.5-72B (Alibaba, 2024) [27] A large-scale open-source LLM with 72 billion parameters, Qwen2.5 is trained on diverse multilingual corpora and instruction-tuned for general-purpose reasoning. It offers strong performance on standard NLP benchmarks and is capable of effective in-context learning. – Qwen-Turbo (Alibaba, 2025) [23] A smaller and more efficient sibling of Qwen2.5, Qwen-Turbo optimized for low latency and resource-constrained environments. Despite its compact size, it performs well on common tasks and is designed for real-time applications. – DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek, 2025) [25] An open-source model designed with multimodal extensions and a large-scale pretraining corpus. DeepSeek-V3 emphasizes efficiency and broad task coverage, although prior studies suggest it may face limitations in specialized linguistic domains. All models were accessed via their official APIs with model checkpoints up- dated as of July 2025. To ensure consistency and reproducibility, our experiments were deployed using an internal benchmarking service that automated querying, decoding, logging, and evaluation workflows for all tested systems. 5.3 Experiment Results Exp1 - Performance by Pronouns Zero-shot VS Few-shot. We inves- tigate how different models (LLMs) handle pronoun resolution under zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings a diverse set of gen- dered, gender-neutral, and neopronouns, as in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. According to the results, few-shot prompting significantly boosts performance across all evaluated models, though the degree of improvement --- Page 11 in LLMs 11 Pronouns Models he she they ze e co ae ey xe thon vi GPT-4o 96.3 95.2 98.2 97.1 96.9 98.3 95.8 98.9 96.1 95.9 95.3 Claude-4-Sonnet 90.2 94.1 99.1 99.4 94.7 99.4 97.0 99.4 100 99.8 92.9 DeepSeek-V3 21.0 15.7 24.0 31.2 1.4 49.9 17.2 27.9 46.5 70.0 1.2 Qwen-Turbo 88.8 88.8 64.4 70.4 50.8 73.1 73.5 61.4 55.7 49.1 60.1 Qwen2.5-72B 87.3 86.4 94.2 80.2 64.9 74.5 69.8 85.4 71.5 78.7 66.4 Table 3: Accuracy(%) by Pronouns for LLMs (Zero-shot) vi GPT-4o 93.3 95.9 99.4 98.8 97.0 99.0 97.9 99.7 98.8 93.9 98.0 Claude-4-Sonnet 86.4 89.0 96.3 100 98.9 99.9 99.7 99.[PHONE].3 DeepSeek-V3 77.9 83.6 99.7 97.3 90.9 95.8 84.2 93.4 92.6 72.6 85.8 Qwen-Turbo 76.3 80.6 79.4 87.6 72.9 54.8 77.5 88.3 74.8 48.2 69.0 Qwen2.5-72B 80.3 85.1 98.4 94.5 92.2 95.5 97.9 96.8 97.7 89.2 90.4 Table 4: for LLMs (Few-shot) varies. GPT-4o and Claude-4-Sonnet already perform strongly in zero-shot set- tings, but still show marginal gains with few-shot examples, particularly on less common neopronouns. In contrast, models like DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-Turbo, and Qwen2.5 exhibit substantial improvement when few-shot demonstrations are in- troduced. GPT-4o performs consistently well across both settings. In zero-shot, it achieves high accuracy on canonical pronouns (e.g., he: 96.3%, she: 95.2%, they: 98.2%) and maintains over 95% accuracy across most neopronouns. With few-shot prompting, performance further improves, reaching above 99% for they, co, ey, and xe, with most neopronouns exceeding 97.5%.Claude also benefits from few-shot prompting, especially on difficult pronouns. For instance, ze improves from 99.4% to 100%, while rare pronouns such as thon and vi jump from 99% to a perfect 100%. Zero-shot accuracy is already robust across all categories, but few-shot examples help consolidate near-perfect consistency. DeepSeek-V3 demonstrates a dramatic disparity between and few-shot conditions. In zero-shot, performance is notably poor on both common and rare (e.g., he: 21.0%, e: 1.4%, vi: 1.2%), indicating a limited ability to generalize without examples. However, with few-shot prompting, DeepSeek-V3 drastically improves across the board, achieving 99.7% on they, 97.3% on ze, and over 85% on most other neopronouns. Qwen-Turbo shows moderate zero-shot capabilities on binary pronouns (e.g., he, she) but struggles with neutrality and neopro- nouns. For example, they drops to 64.4%, and rare forms like thon fall below 50%. In the few-shot setting, we observe improvements across all pronouns, with ze reaching 87.6% and even the weakest pronouns (e.g., co, xe) climbing above 70%. Similar to DeepSeek, Qwen2.5 benefits noticeably from few-shot prompt- ing. Accuracy on pronouns like they, ae, and ey increases from the 60–80% range in zero-shot to 95–98% in few-shot. The model exhibits the most improvement on neopronouns, especially co (74.5% →95.5%) and xe (71.5% →97.7%). Exp2 Performance by Grammatical Forms Zero-shot vs. Few-shot.

In the zero-shot setting, frontier and Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrate strong consistency across grammatical categories, with average accuracy scores of 96.7% and 96.9%, respectively. However, their performance shows slight variation across categories: GPT-4o drops to 90.4% on reflexive forms, and Claude dips to 94.6% in the same category. Other models like Qwen2.5 and Qwen-Turbo exhibit larger fluctuations. For example, Qwen- Turbo achieves above 91% on nominative and accusative cases, struggles with possessive-independent (34.2%) and reflexive (52.0%) forms. DeepSeek-V3 performs particularly poorly under zero-shot, with overall average accuracy at only 27.8%, and some categories like accusative low as 17.4%. few-shot prompting, we observe significant gains across all models and grammatical types. GPT-4o improves its reflexive handling from 90.4% to 98.7%, and maintains high scores across other forms. DeepSeek-V3, which previously failed in zero-shot, now reaches an average of 88.5%, closing the gap with stronger competitors. Qwen- Turbo also improves from 66.9% to 73.6%, but continues to lag in possessive and reflexive pronouns. Interestingly, few-shot prompting not only raises the floor for underperforming models but also narrows performance gaps across grammatical types. The average accuracy across all forms increases from 73.3% zero-shot to 89.8% in few-shot, highlighting the value of minimal supervision in helping LLMs resolve syntactic complexity in gendered language. In conclusion, while and Claude exhibit grammatical robustness in both conditions, few- shot examples are particularly crucial for boosting lower-performing models and achieving more balanced pronoun handling across grammatical forms. --- Page 13 in LLMs 13 Exp3 - Gender Identity Inference. Table 7 shows the result of our experi- ment conducted for Inference task for five models. In this task, we evaluate whether models can accurately infer a user’s declared pronouns solely on contextual usage. Each example contains a consistent usage of a pronoun set (e.g., xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself ) within naturalistic sentences, and model must choose correct pronoun set from a candidate list. This setup probes reverse inference and bias, especially for uncommon or mismatched name–pronoun combinations. shown in the table 7, GPT-4o and Claude-4- Sonnet exhibit near-perfect across all name–pronoun groupings. GPT- 4o achieves 100% accuracy for both match and mismatch sets, confirming its robust context-to-pronoun generalisation. Claude-4-Sonnet follows closely with 95.6% on mismatch and 99.0% on match sets. Qwen2.5-72B performs well over- all, attaining 81.2% on mismatched combinations and 98.1% on matched ones. However, the smaller Qwen-Turbo model struggles with mismatches, highlight- ing its susceptibility to name-pronoun co-occurrence bias. DeepSeek-V3 achieves relatively strong mismatch generalisation and excellent performance on matched cases, yet still lags behind GPT-4o on rare pronoun In the breakdown by name, gender, and class, most models perform best when given unisex names (e.g., Alex, Taylor) and matched pronoun forms. For example, Qwen2.5-72B and DeepSeek-V3 show over 99% accuracy for unisex name-pronoun matches, but performance degrades on mismatched gendered pairs name with feminine pronouns), revealing residual bias in name-to-gender priors. Overall, re- sults indicate that modern LLMs can correctly back-infer pronoun declarations with high accuracy in controlled prompts, though biases persist for less-aligned or nontraditional associations. This validates name-prediction as a useful diag- nostic for identity inference and model bias detection. 6 Discussion 6.1 Result Analysis The results from Experiments 1 through 3 reveal clear stratification in model capabilities across pronoun resolution, grammatical consistency, and gender iden- tity inference. Across all three tasks, and Claude-4-Sonnet consistently demonstrate superior performance, while open-source models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen variants lag behind, especially in zero-shot conditions. Few-shot prompting as a performance equalizer. Few-shot prompting dramatically improves model performance, particularly for those with weaker baseline abilities. As for DeepSeek-V3 jumps from 21.0% on he to 77.9%, and similar leaps occur across other neopronouns. This suggests that while some models may lack robust zero-shot generalization, they retain latent syntactic capabilities that can be activated with minimal context. For models like GPT-4o and Claude-4, the improvements are less dramatic but still notable, reinforcing their robustness across diverse input styles.

Both models originate from organizations primarily focused on the multilingual market, and it’s plausible that English data constitutes a smaller portion of their pretraining corpora. Moreover, less investment in English-centric alignment and inclusive language modeling may result in limited exposure to nonbinary pronoun usage or syntactic nuance, hampering generalization in these tasks. This hypothesis is supported by the stark contrast between their zero-shot and few- shot performance, suggesting a capability that exists but remains unactivated without explicit contextual cues. Comparative Trends with the MISGENDERED Study. The earlier study evaluated such as ChatGPT (March 2023), Alpaca, and Flan-T5 on the orgininal benchmark. Several notable trends emerge when comparing the 2023 and 2025 evaluations. First, the overall accuracy of LLMs on neopronouns has significantly improved. In 2023, even the best-performing model (ChatGPT) struggled with less common forms like xe/xem, ze/zir, and thon, achieving only around 75% accuracy under zero-shot settings. By contrast, our 2025 evaluations show that and Claude-4-Sonnet exceed 95% accuracy on nearly all neo- pronouns, with several exceeding 99% under few-shot prompting.This reflects stronger internalization of inclusive linguistic forms and better alignment with gender-diverse usage. Second, grammatical consistency has also improved. Re- --- Page 15 in LLMs 15 flexive and possessive-dependent forms posed persistent challenges, with lower across all tested models. results show modern LLMs have narrowed these gaps. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 98.7% accuracy on reflexive forms and over 95% on possessive-dependent forms in few-shot setting, out- performing past models by a large margin. This indicates LLMs have become significantly better at handling the structure and rules of how words change and relate to each other in a sentence, especially for pronouns with differ- ent grammatical forms. While earlier models struggled to handle rare pronouns and mismatched contexts, today’s top-performing models exhibit near-human performance, provided minimal contextual guidance. This underscores the im- pact of larger model sizes, improved training datasets, and instruction tuning in bridging representational fairness gaps in LLMs. 6.2 Future Directions Remaining Gaps. Despite considerable advancements over prior work, in- cluding improved zero-shot accuracy and higher consistency across and gender-neutral pronouns, several critical gaps persist: – Incomplete Generalization Across Pronoun Types: Leading such as GPT- 4o Claude 4 demonstrate performance on commonly used pronouns. However, they still falter on less frequent neopronouns like xe/xem, ze/hir, and novel invented forms. These gaps reflect the underrepresentation of such forms in pretraining data and limitations of tokenization-based learning, particularly for rare or fragmented tokens. – Name-Based Gender Heuristics Persist: In the reverse name-to-pronoun pre- diction task, several models defaulted binary based on stereotypical gender associations of names, even when such predictions contradicted explicitly declared or implied pronoun usage. suggests that implicit social priors still override context-aware reasoning in many LLMs. – Ethical Incompleteness in Benchmark Design: Although the original DERED benchmark was a major step forward, its structure did not require explicit consent. Our MISGENDERED+ variant improves this by mandating declarations and including name–pronoun mismatches, but gaps in cov- erage (e.g., intersectional identities, multilingual settings) remain. Key Challenges. Building on the identified gaps, we outline three fundamental challenges facing the development of gender-inclusive LLMs: – Inclusive Data Scarcity: Collecting sufficiently diverse, high-quality, and context- rich training data that includes inclusive pronoun usage, especially neopronouns and nonbinary identity expressions, remains a significant challenge. These forms are often underrepresented in mainstream leading to gaps in represen- tation and limiting LLMs’ exposure. – Evaluation Ambiguity: Measuring fidelity inclusivity in LLMs is inherently complex due to the lack of standardized metrics, context-sensitive --- Page 16 --- 16 et al. interpretations, and overlapping grammatical and social cues. This makes it challenging to reliably assess whether a model’s output is both syntactically correct and socially respectful, especially in edge cases involving neopronouns or ambiguous identity contexts. Future Work. To advance the responsible development of inclusive language models, we propose several research directions: – Augmented Training with Inclusive Corpora: Future LLMs should be finetuned or adapted using corpora enriched with gender-diverse, non-binary, and neopronoun- inclusive narratives. Such data augmentation can mitigate exposure bias and improve generalization to underrepresented forms. – Probabilistic Pronoun Modeling: Inspired by Bayesian and non-parametric frame- works, integrating dynamic pronoun preferences as learned distributions may support better personalization and context adaptation. Models could be designed to condition on user-declared identities with formal uncertainty representations. – Community-Centered Evaluation and Co-Design: Inclusive benchmarks should be built in collaboration with queer, trans, and non-binary communities. Crowd- sourcing and participatory design can help ensure that metrics reflect lived expe- rience and that systems are not only technically accurate but socially respectful. 7 Related Work Fairness Surveys in LLMs. Recent comprehensive surveys [12] systematically categorise bias evaluation methods across multiple demographic dimensions, in- cluding race, gender, religion, and socio-economic status. They highlight that many evaluation strategies still inadequately address the spectrum of pronoun diversity, especially where non-binary neopronouns are concerned. This sur- vey distinguishes between intrinsic fairness, bias inherent in model representa- tions, and extrinsic fairness, manifested in downstream tasks. They argue that even with debiasing interventions, underrepresented identities continue to suf- fer disproportionately in open-ended generations and reasoning contexts. Simi- larly, another study [8] provides a three-tier taxonomy (embeddings, probabil- ities, text-generation) to evaluate bias and notes that most existing datasets fail to adequately reflect gender diversity and pronoun usage. In addition, the work [18] expands on these frameworks, offering a broader overview of bias types and mitigation strategies across model scales, yet still lack targeted coverage of pronoun robustness. Further study [7] introduces a multi-turn conversational fairness benchmark, demonstrating how biases can accumulate across dialogue, notably when are used, and yet it omits fine-grained pronoun diversity evaluation. Demographically Diverse Benchmarks. The work [22] introduced the Parity Benchmark, which systematically evaluates LLMs across demographic attributes such as gender, race, age, and ability. It employs controlled, balanced prompts to assess model parity in responses; however, their benchmark design omits explicit --- Page 17 in LLMs 17 attention to diversity, especially and neopronouns. Futhere- more, the CCSV-based diversity benchmarks [11] were proposed, analyzing how LLMs self-critique and self-vote to improve demographic representation in gen- erated lists (e.g. names or entities). While this benchmark explicitly measures people diversity, it still does not examine whether models correctly adapt pro- noun forms in discourse contexts. A study [19] complement this perspective with DiversityMedQA, focusing on medical question answering across patient gender and ethnicity. Their findings reveal significant performance disparities, under- scoring that even domain-specific benchmarks must account for demographic variation. Yet, similar to other studies, pronoun usage is treated only indirectly through gender perturbations. Moreover, existing surveys and theoretical anal- yses [5, 13] highlight that benchmark effectiveness is contingent on capturing data attributes like diversity, difficulty, and linguistic nuance. Pronoun diver- sity remains a major blind spot in this context, even though benchmarks like SoFa [14] begin to explore nuanced identity expressions. Overall, while these benchmark efforts significantly improve our understanding of LLM fairness and representation, they commonly omit fine-grained assessments of pronoun varia- tion, particularly and neopronouns. 8 Conclusion In this paper, we presented enhanced for evaluating models (LLMs) ability to handle inclusive pronoun usage. Building upon original MISGENDERED framework, we in- troduced new task designs and evaluated five recent LLMs, including both com- mercial (GPT-4o, Claude-4-Sonnet) and open-source (Qwen2.5, Qwen-Turbo, DeepSeek-V3) show that while modern aligned models have significantly improved in handling and neopronouns, challenges persist, particularly for open-source systems and in identity inference tasks where name-based bias can mislead predictions. The benchmark reveals key insights into how current LLMs process identity cues, highlights gaps in fairness under conditions of syntactic ambiguity and pronoun complexity, and provides essential groundwork for further research into bias detection, inclu- sive language generation, and development of more equitable, accountable, and socially responsible LLM systems worldwide.

However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while ex- cessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion Large Language Models. DAEDAL op- erates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation re- gions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves perfor- mance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation. 1 INTRODUCTION Models (DLLMs) (Nie et al., 2025; DeepMind, 2025; Inception Labs et al., 2025) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for Language Models (LLMs)(Yang al., 2025; Achiam et al., 2023), garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. Unlike the conventional autoregressive (AR) framework, which generates text sequentially via next- token prediction, DLLMs operate through a multi-step iterative denoising process. By leveraging bidirectional attention(Vaswani et al., 2017) to refine an initially masked sequence into a coherent output, this approach offers several distinct advantages(Nie et al., 2024), including the ability to utilize global context for tasks that require holistic planning, a flexible trade-off between the number of inference steps and the quality of the generated sample. Given these unique properties, DLLMs have become a compelling research direction that offers an to the autoregressive paradigm. Despite their promising potential, the inference of DLLMs suffers from a fundamental limitation rooted in their denoising paradigm: the denoise from a fully-masked sequence of a fixed length, hence final output length is also statically predefined. This static setup leads to flawed inference ∗This work is done during an internship in Shanghai AI Laboratory. † Corresponding author 1 arXiv:2508.00819v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- Performance [CREDIT_CARD] [CREDIT_CARD] . . .

(a) DAEDAL uses a uni- fied and short initial length, consistently surpassing the baseline, which needs its length meticulously tuned for each benchmark to achieve peak performance. (b) DAEDAL dynamically adjusts length and adaptively expands on a per-problem basis, resulting in a varied distribution of response lengths. In contrast, the baseline is constrained to a fixed length for all problems. compared to their autoregressive counterpart: AR LLMs flexibly adjust the output length based on the given task, while DLLMs must adapt the task output the given length. The requirement of a manually pre-defined length to a severe dilemma. An overly short length hinders the model from solving complex problems due to an insufficient token length. Conversely, universally adopting a long generation length introduces a new set of issues. First, it incurs large computational overhead due to the quadratic complexity of bidirectional attention. Second, as shown in Figure 1 (a), observe that excessively long initial lengths may degrade model performance. This rigid, pre-defined length constraint not only creates the dilemma at the outset of inference, but more fundamentally, it cripples the model’s ability to adapt dynamically. For instance, DLLMs lack the critical test-time scaling capability(Muennighoff al., 2025) of AR models, which can extend their output to self-correct (e.g., “Wait, let me rethink...”)(Shah al., 2025; Wei et al., 2022). This problem is exacerbated by the non-sequential generation nature of DLLMs. A model might generate the beginning and end of a sequence first, only to find the allocated space for intermediate reasoning insufficient, leading directly to incomplete logic and degraded performance. Fortunately, we find the solution lies within the DLLM’s intrinsic capabilities — its planning ability. In each denoise step, the model plans final output by predicting all the mask tokens with different confidence. We discovered that the model’s prediction confidence acts as a powerful, general-purpose signal indicating whether the generation space is sufficient. For example, in Figure 2, in the first denoising step (t=1), the model confidently predicts more End-of-Sequence tokens (EOS) from the fully masked sequence when the length is sufficient for task, while less confident in predicting EOS length is insufficient. This core insight paves way for variable-length denoising strategies, and we present Models. DAEDAL operates phases: 1) Initial Length Adjustment. coarse task-appropriate length. The expansion is sequence completion metric, which is calculated by the predicted confidence of EOS tokens within a fixed window. 2) Iterative Mask Insertion. DAEDAL dynamically expands the sequence to develop a better output. expansion is realized by inserting mask tokens into insufficient regions, where the model struggles to plan and the corresponding prediction confidence is quite low. With DAEDAL, DLLMs no longer require manually tuned, task-specific generation lengths. Instead, they can start from a short, unified length and dynamically expand as needed.

The heatmaps show the difference in average EOS token confidence at the sequence terminus, measured after the first prediction on a fully masked 128-token input. This difference is the result of subtracting the average confidence on length-insufficient problems (those answered correctly only with a much longer sequence) from that on length-sufficient answered correctly under 128 tokens). The experiment is conducted with LLaDA-Instruct-8B. The predominantly green color (difference > 0) indicates that EOS confidence is higher for length-sufficient problems, validating our core insight. that DAEDAL not only allocates appropriate computational resources for diverse tasks, in Figure 1(b), but also achieves performance that is superior, to the peak performance of tuned fixed-length baselines. Our method thus achieves strong performance while significantly improving computational efficiency. 2 RELATED WORKS Language Models. In recent years, Diffusion Models (DLLMs) have as a prominent area of research. Among them, LLaDA(Nie al., 2025) stands out as the first large-scale diffusion model trained from scratch to reach the billion-parameter scale. Trained on 2.3 trillion tokens, LLaDA-8B has demonstrated performance competitive with state-of-the-art autoregressive models like LLaMA-3-8B(Grattafiori et al., 2024) on multiple tasks(Hendrycks et al., 2020; Suzgun et al., 2022; Cobbe et al., 2021), proving the remarkable scalability and potential of the native diffusion architecture. Subsequently, LLaDA-1.5(Zhu al., 2025) advanced this paradigm by successfully applying reinforcement learning for preference alignment, achieving significant further improvements on benchmarks for mathematics, code, and alignment. In contrast to LLaDA, another line of research has explored adapting existing AR LLMs into DLLMs. For instance, models like DiffuLLaMA(Gong al., 2024) and Dream(Ye al., 2025) were developed by fine-tuning pre-trained AR LLMs such as GPT2(Radford et al., 2019), LLaMA2(Touvron et al., 2023) and Qwen(Yang et al., 2024). While these adapted models have also achieved strong results, our work focuses on native, from-scratch DLLMs like LLaDA, seeking to explore their generation mechanisms and address the specific challenge of fixed-length inference. Inference Strategies for DLLMs. Existing research on inference strategies for DLLMs has predomi- nantly focused on enhancing generation speed through computational optimizations. For example, Fast-dLLM(Wu al., 2025) introduces a novel block-wise approximate Key-Value (KV) Cache tailored for bidirectional attention models, combined with a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy, to achieve up to an improvement in throughput. Similarly, dLLM-Cache(Liu al., 2025) observes the static nature of prompts and the dynamic sparsity of responses during DLLM inference, proposing an adaptive caching framework that combines long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates to achieve lossless speedup. Dimple(Yu al., 2025) proposes a “Confident Decod- ing” strategy that dynamically adjusts number of tokens generated at each step based on model confidence, thereby significantly reducing the total number of iterations. In summary, while all these methods(Ma al., 2025; Israel al., 2025; Ben-Hamu 2025) have made significant strides in improving the inference speed of DLLMs via computational caching and parallel decoding. They do not address the more fundamental issue that the generation length itself needs to adapt dynamically to different task requirements. To our knowledge, the problem of dynamically adjusting and expanding the total generation length of DLLMs at inference time remains unexplored. Our work, therefore, aims to fill this critical gap by proposing a novel dynamic adaptive expansion strategy. 3 --- Page 4 --- Denoising (Baseline) (b) DAEDAL Prompt token MASK token Predicted token (1st iteration) Denoised tokens The denoising order Predefined generation length ①Model predicts the tokens for all MASK positions. ②Retain selected tokens and remask others. ①and ② Repeat ①and ②until no MASK tokens left. …… Initial Length Adjustment Iterative Mask Insertion token (1st and 2nd iteration) Initial length Expanded MASK token ”Expansion point” token …… MASK positions. ① Check EOS confidence, determine length is insufficient, and expand.

(b) Our proposed two-stage inference process, which first employs Length Adjustment to determine an appropriate generation length before denoising, followed by Mask Insertion to expand the sequence on-demand during the denoising process. 3 METHODS 3.1 OVERVIEW OF LANGUAGE MODELS Training. The training of a Diffusion Language Model aims to define and learn a model distribution pθ(x0) that approximates the true data distribution. This is achieved through a forward and a reverse probabilistic process(Austin et al., 2021a; Ou al., 2024). The forward process defines a fixed data noising mechanism indexed by a continuous time variable t ∈[0, 1]. It progressively masks an original sequence x0 until it is fully masked at t = 1. For any given t, a noised version xt is generated by independently replacing each token in x0 with a [MASK] token with probability t, while keeping it unchanged with probability 1 −t. The reverse process is where learning occurs. A Transformer model, parameterized by θ, is trained to reverse the forward process by learning to predict the sequence x0 from its noised version xt. is achieved by optimizing the model to minimize a cross-entropy loss computed only on the masked token positions. This objective is principled as it corresponds to maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) on the data’s log-likelihood, thereby pushing the model distribution pθ to approximate data distribution. Inference. During inference, LLaDA employs iterative denoising process to generate text. As illustrated in Figure 3(a), this process begins with sequence of length L composed entirely of [MASK] tokens, where L is a predefined hyperparameter. In each denoising step t, the model 4 --- Page 5 --- takes the current sequence xt as input and for all masked positions, yielding an estimate ˆx0 of the complete, clean sequence. Subsequently, a “remasking” strategy is applied to determine which tokens are finalized and which are re-masked for the next denoising step, t −1. LLaDA demonstrates the effectiveness of a “low-confidence remasking” strategy(Nie al., 2025; Chang et al., 2022), where tokens predicted with the highest confidence are kept, while those with low confidence re-masked for further refinement in subsequent steps. This iterative process continues for a fixed number of steps until the final text sequence is generated. This standard inference pipeline exposes a core problem: generation length L must be statically specified before inference begins, preventing it from adapting to the actual requirements of the task. 3.2 DAEDAL To address static length limitation of standard DLLM inference, we DAEDAL, a training-free, two-stage strategy. This approach allows model to allocate an appropriate sequence length for each task and to insert additional space for reasoning where needed. A detailed algorithmic description of this process is provided in Algorithm 1. 3.2.1 INITIAL LENGTH ADJUSTMENT To overcome the limitation of a static generation length, we introduce the first stage of DAEDAL, Length Adjustment. The core insight of this stage is the model’s confidence in generating an End-of-Sequence (EOS) token at the end of the sequence can be interpreted as an internal signal of whether the current token length is sufficient. To validate this insight, we visualize the model’s behavior in Figure 2. Specifically, we measure the average EOS the sequence terminus the first prediction, when the predefined generation length is 128. We then compare this confidence between two empirically defined groups of problems: those answered correctly in under 128 tokens (length-sufficient) and much longer sequence (length- insufficient). The visualization clearly shows the model predicts EOS tokens with significantly higher confidence for the length-sufficient problems, indicating an awareness that the current length is adequate. Conversely, for problems where is insufficient, the model utilizes the available space more thoroughly, resulting in lower at the sequence’s terminus. If the model deems current length inadequate to fully articulate its response, it will tend to utilize all available space, making it less likely to generate tokens with high confidence. Based on insight, we introduce a preliminary length estimation loop that precedes the main denoising process. As depicted in Figure 3(b), this loop with short initial generation length. In each estimation iteration, the model performs a forward pass on current sequence (prompt plus [MASK] tokens) to evaluate its predictions. We specifically focus on a window the sequence and calculate the model’s average confidence in predicting the EOS token in these positions. If this confidence falls below a predefined threshold, we interpret this as a “length insufficient” signal. This indicates that the model, being forced to conclude prematurely, has not yet formed a complete response and is therefore unwilling to commit to an EOS token. In response, we expand generation length by appending additional [MASK] tokens to of the sequence. This length adjustment loop repeats until the EOS confidence surpasses the threshold or a maximum length limit is reached. Through this mechanism, DAEDAL dynamically allocates a task-appropriate generation length for the model before commencing the fine-grained denoising process. 3.2.2 ITERATIVE MASK INSERTION After first stage allocates an appropriate for the task, the second of DAEDAL, Iterative Mask Insertion, further enhances generation flexibility denoising process. We propose that predictions with exceptionally confidence are not merely signals of uncertainty; on a deeper level, they indicate that the local context is too constrained to articulate a complex thought or logical step. In other words, this is a signal the model requires more “discursive space” to refine its reasoning. Therefore, during each denoising step, in addition to identifying and filling high-confidence tokens, our method also flags the masked position with the lowest prediction confidence, provided it below a very low threshold. As 3(b), this position is not treated as merely a “difficult token” but is marked as an “expansion point”. When a position is marked for expansion, instead 5 --- Page 6 --- Algorithm 1 The DAEDAL Inference Process 1: Input: Prompt c, model fθ, initial/max length Linit/Lmax, thresholds τeos, τhigh, τlow, τexpand, expansion factor Efactor, EOS confidence window size Weos 2: Output: Generated sequence y ▷Stage 1: Length Adjustment 3: x ←[c, [MASK], . . , [MASK] | {z } Linit ] ▷Initialize sequence 4: while length(x) τhigh} ▷Identify high-confidence set for filling 18: Icandidates ←{i | i ∈Mmasked ∧Pconf,i 0 then 24: iexpand ←arg mini∈Icandidates Pconf,i ▷Select the the lowest confidence 25: Replace xiexpand with [[MASK], {z } Efactor ] ▷Expand sequence at the selected position 26: end if 27: end while 28: return x of simply remasking it, we dynamically replace the single token with a block of multiple [MASK] tokens. This operation effectively inserts additional space into sequence. This mechanism provides the model with “breathing room” precisely where complex reasoning or detailed description is needed, allowing it to better structure its language and logic in subsequent denoising iterations. Unlike the first stage, which performs a holistic length adjustment, Mask Insertion is a localized, on-demand refinement that occurs in real-time during generation. This enables DAEDAL to handle complex scenarios where the required length exceeds the initial length estimate, significantly enhancing the model’s expressive ability. 4 EXPERIMENTS 4.1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS We utilize LLaDA-Instruct-8B and LLaDA-1.5-8B as our baseline models. To ensure fairness and reproducibility, all experiments are conducted using the official generation code released with LLaDA, without any acceleration or caching optimizations proposed in subsequent works. All experiments were conducted on a server equipped with 8 NVIDIA A800 80G GPUs, with the batch size set to 8. 6 --- Page 7 --- Table 1: Main Results of DAEDAL on LLaDA-Instruct-8B.

For mathematical reasoning, we utilize GSM8K(Cobbe al., 2021), which consists of grade-school math word problems to assess multi-step reasoning, and the more challenging MATH500(Lightman al., 2023) benchmark, composed of competition-level mathematics problems; performance on both is measured by accuracy. To evaluate code generation, we employ MBPP(Austin et al., 2021b) benchmark for entry-level Python tasks the more complex, handwritten HumanEval(Chen et al., 2021) benchmark to test program synthesis capabilities. For these code generation tasks, we report the pass@1 metric to assess the correctness the generated code in a single attempt. 4.3 MAIN RESULTS We conducted a comprehensive evaluation on four benchmarks. The results for LLaDA-Instruct-8B and LLaDA-1.5-8B, comparing the Fixed-Length Denoising baseline against our DAEDAL method, are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. For the baseline models, performance is highly dependent on manually tuning for each specific task. We therefore report baseline performance across six fixed-length configurations, from 64 to 2048 tokens. In addition to accuracy (Acc), we introduce three key metrics: tokens generated (Ntoken), which baseline is its preset fixed length; number of effective tokens used to answer the question (Etoken), representing the “net” response length after removing trailing EOS padding; and effective token ratio (Eratio). DAEDAL strong performance with a unified initial length. The results clearly demon- strate the superior performance of DAEDAL. Despite starting initial length by default, DAEDAL’s two-stage length adjustment and expansion mechanism allows it to not only significantly 7 --- Page . . [CREDIT_CARD] 256 . .

This finding highlights effectiveness of DAEDAL and exposes the inherent impracticality of the fixed-length paradigm, as the optimal the baseline varies across different benchmarks, un- derscoring the necessity of dynamic length adaptation. To visually illustrate this dynamic adaptability, Figure 4 contrasts of total generation lengths (Ntoken) used by DAEDAL against the fixed length of the best-performing baseline for each benchmark. Unlike baseline, which to a single, pre-defined for all problems, DAEDAL automatically adapts its generation length in a diverse length distribution that reflects varying task complexity. DAEDAL adaptively finds the optimal generation length. Further analysis reveals that DAEDAL intelligently estimates and generates responses of an appropriate length. In most cases, effective tokens (Etoken) produced by DAEDAL is comparable to that of the baseline’s best- performing configuration. This suggests that finds the model’s inherent “sweet spot” for the token length required by given task. The baseline’s behavior corroborates this: when the fixed length is set beyond its optimal point, performance degrades even though effective tokens may continue to increase. DAEDAL’s adaptive nature effectively avoids this performance decay from over-expansion. DAEDAL significantly improves computational efficiency. Furthermore, DAEDAL offers signifi- cant efficiency advantages. While achieving superior accuracy, of tokens (Ntoken) generated DAEDAL is generally lower than of the baseline at its peak-performance setting. A similar effective token count with a lower total token count in a much ratio (Eratio). This dramatically improves the utilization of the computational resource by reducing the overhead of bidirectional attention on unnecessarily long sequences and minimizing wasted resources on generating meaningless padding tokens. In summary, our results demonstrate that DAEDAL, through its Length Adjustment and Mask Insertion, not only achieves performance comparable, and at times tuned fixed-length baselines across multiple benchmarks but also adaptively for each task. This leads to substantial gains in both model performance and computational efficiency. 4.4 ANALYSIS ON DAEDAL DAEDAL’s two stages are individually effective and synergistic when combined. shown in Table 3, we conducted an ablation study to analyze the individual contributions of DAEDAL’s two 8 --- Page 9 --- Table 2: DAEDAL on LLaDA-1.5-8B.

The results indicate that applying either stage individually yields significant performance gains over the baseline. The full DAEDAL method, which combines both stages, ultimately achieves the best performance, surpassing the results of using either stage alone. This demonstrates that the stages are complementary and indispensable for achieving optimal results. DAEDAL’s stages highlights the importance of initial length for global planning. When using the Insertion (Stage 2) stage in isolation, observe that its performance is sensitive to the initial length. When starting from a very initial length (e.g., 64), its performance, while substantially better than baseline at that same length, still falls short the baseline’s peak performance achieved at an optimal, longer length. Yet, when initiated with a more reasonable length (e.g., 256), this stage alone can surpass the baseline’s overall best result. This behavior is expected and highlights the nature of second stage as a local, on-demand expansion mechanism. If initial length is severely constrained, the DLLM’s ability to form a sound global plan for the solution is compromised from the outset. While subsequent local expansions can provide remedies, the overall performance ceiling is still limited by the flawed initial plan. This not only effectiveness of Mask Insertion but also underscores necessity of Adjustment (Stage 1) for establishing a solid foundation global planning. DAEDAL exhibits strong robustness initial length. A core advantage of DAEDAL is its ability to achieve strong performance initial length. We conduct study to verify its robustness to this hyperparameter, Linit. in Table 4, DAEDAL delivers remarkably stable performance across a wide range of initial lengths, from 32 to 512 tokens. On HumanEval, the accuracy remains identical across all settings, while the variation on GSM8K is negligible. This result demonstrates that DAEDAL is largely insensitive initial length setting. It confirms that users do not need to meticulously tune this hyperparameter; a unified length (e.g., 64) is sufficient to achieve optimal performance, fulfilling its original design objective. 9 --- Page 10 --- Table 3: Ablation Results of DAEDAL’s Two Stages.

This result suggests that the specific granularity of each expansion step is not critical. A smaller factor leads to more frequent, fine-grained expansions, while a larger factor results in fewer, coarser expansions. Regardless of the step size, the model robustly converges to a similar, task-appropriate total length. This finding further corroborates our core hypothesis the model possesses a strong internal estimate of the length required a given problem, and DAEDAL’s mechanism effectively enables model to reach that target. DAEDAL is robust to confidence window size, achieving optimal with a large window. We also analyze the sensitivity window size, used to determine length sufficiency. in right Table 5, performance is stable for larger window sizes but degrades for very small values (e.g., 8). Notably, even this sub-optimal configuration still yields significant over baseline at a comparable initial length (77.3 vs. 48.0 Acc on GSM8K when the baseline starts at Linit=64). We attribute the performance drop at small window sizes to a higher probability of misjudging the model’s intent.

The results demonstrate remarkable stability, with all configurations comparable to the best-performing baseline, and some even outperforming it. a more robust signal by averaging confidence over a wider context. In contrast, a small window is susceptible to localized fluctuations and may prematurely terminate length expansion based on a few high-confidence EOS tokens the sequence’s immediate end, leading to length under-allocation and a drop in final performance. DAEDAL demonstrates broad robustness across its threshold settings. We conduct a comprehensive study on all the four key threshold hyperparameters in DAEDAL: τeos, τexpand, τhigh, τlow. We analyze these in interdependent pairs via a grid search: (τhigh, τlow), which govern token-level filling and expansion decisions. Specifically, the high-confidence threshold τhighcis analogous to the confident decoding strategy proposed in Dimple, which aims to accelerate inference by simultaneously filling all tokens that exceed a certain confidence level. The second pair, (τeos, τexpand), controls sequence-level length adjustments. The results on GSM8K, presented in Figure 5, demonstrate DAEDAL’s exceptional robustness. Across the 32 tested configurations, all configurations are best-performing baseline (83.8 Acc), with some even outper- forming it, and overall performance variation across all settings is minimal. indicates to the precise choice of these thresholds, confirming that it can deliver strong and stable performance without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. 5 CONCLUSION In this work, we addressed a fundamental architectural constraint of Large Language Models: the reliance on length. This limitation hinders their practical application by creating a difficult dilemma: tasks, while excessive lengths not only computational overhead but can sometimes lead to performance degradation. We introduced a novel training-free, two-stage strategy that resolves this issue by leveraging the model’s own internal signals. DAEDAL first performs an Adjustment to set a coarse, task-appropriate budget, and then uses Insertion to dynamically the sequence at regions requiring more detailed reasoning denoising process. Our extensive experiments and analyses that DAEDAL successfully endows DLLMs with the ability for dynamic, per-problem length adaptation. This allows a model initial length to superior, that fixed-length baselines. By removing need for manual length tuning and enabling model to find its own optimal response length, not only enhances performance but also computational efficiency. Ultimately, this work bridges a critical capability gap between diffusion and autoregressive models, for more flexible, efficient, and capable non-autoregressive language generation. 11 --- Page 12 --- REFERENCES Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al.

Title: GHTM: A Graph based Hybrid Topic Modeling Approach in Low-Resource Bengali Language Authors: Farhana Haque, Md. Abdur Rahman, Sumon Ahmed Date: [PHONE] URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00605v1 --- Page 1 --- Bengali Language Farhana Haque IIT, University of Dhaka Dhaka, Bangladesh [EMAIL] Md. Abdur Rahman CARS, Bangladesh [EMAIL] Dr. Sumon Ahmed Bangladesh [EMAIL] Abstract Topic modeling is a Natural Language Pro- cessing (NLP) technique that is used to iden- tify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to its mor- phological complexity, lack of adequate re- sources and initiatives. In this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called GHTM (Graph-Based Hy- brid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce se- mantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using Non-negative Ma- trix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical rep- resentations of the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro- posed model by outperforming other models in topic coherence and diversity. In addition, we introduce a novel Bengali dataset called ’NCTBText’ sourced from Bengali textbook materials to enrich and diversify the predomi- nantly newspaper-centric Bengali corpora. 1 Introduction is a powerful unsupervised text mining technique that helps make sense of unstruc- tured and unlabeled real-world data, without the manual labor of going through large volumes of documents. Through clustering words that tend to co-occur frequently across multiple documents, topic models generate insightful and thematic set of words that can enlighten us about the topics from any massive amount of text corpora, which can further contribute in other Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like document classifica- tion, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, ex- ploratory data analysis, etc. The field of topic modeling has advanced a lot re- cently since its inception, from conventional mod- els like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deer- wester et al., 1990), Non-negative Matrix Factor- ization (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 1999) etc. to high-quality sentence embedding based models like BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022), Top2vec (An- gelov, 2020) etc. and neural models like ETM (Di- eng et al., 2020), ProdLDA (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017), NeuralLDA (Card et al., 2018) etc. Ear- lier the text extraction only depended on either Bag-of-Words (BOW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which has later evolved into word-based embeddings and sentence level embeddings. As text vectorization methods improved, topic models also progressed over time from probabilistic and algebraic form to neural net- work and embedding-based models. Even though recent benchmarks for topic model- ing in English are leveraging cutting-edge tools and techniques, Bengali is lagging in this field. modeling has mostly been explored around LDA and extensions of LDA like LDA2Vec (Hasan et al., 2019) and BERT-LDA (Paul et al., 2025). Not only is there a lack of advanced research in Bengali topic modeling, but there is also no widely accepted benchmark dataset for evaluating such models. Most of the available Bengali datasets are scraped from online newspapers, often lacking in variation of topics. This paper presents a novel topic modeling ap- proach, especially for Bengali language, called Graph-based Hybrid Topic Model (GHTM) which is an innovative fusion of TF-IDF weighted GLoVE (Pennington et al., 2014) embeddings, Graph Con- volutional Network (GCN) (Kipf and Welling, 2017)and NMF, that is evaluated against currently arXiv:2508.00605v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 --- Page 2 --- available models and outperforms them coherence and topic diversity. GHTM constructs a k-nearest-neighbor graph, where each document serves as a node, and uses cosine similarity to measure document similarity to connect edges. Documents are represented as TF-IDF-weighted GloVe embeddings, which are subsequently refined through GCN. Finally, NMF is applied to the re- fined embeddings to extract interpretable topics. To ensure compliance with NMFs non-negativity constraint, the refined embeddings are converted to their absolute values. We evaluated range of models, including our proposed approach, on three differently sized datasets. Two of these are publicly available news- paper datasets, while the third is novel Bengali textbook dataset curated from materials provided by Bangladesh’s National Curriculum and Text- book Board (NCTB) website1. The major contributions of this study are as fol- lows: • Development of a novel graph-based topic modeling approach called GHTM. • Generation a novel dataset, NCTBText that introduces diversity into the currently domi- nant Bengali corpora. • A comprehensive comparison of topic mod- eling methods using range of existing and newly generated datasets. 2 Related Work This section reviews related studies, by showing their contributions and identifying key research gaps, that we aim to address in this work. Helal and Mouhoub (2018) took the first step towards topic modeling by applying LDA on Bengali dataset, which shows the efficacy of LDA with bi-grams for Bengali news classification and topic extraction. Hasan et al. (2019) proposes LDA2Vec, which is a combination of the parts of LDA and word2vec. The study shows LDA2Vecs high accuracy over LDA itself in a comparison be- tween these two models on a Bengali newspaper dataset but did not employ more than one dataset. Alam et al. (2020) curated a Bengali dataset con- sisting of 70K news articles and applied LDA to uncover latent topics and observe media trend evo- lution over time in Bengali news. The study of- fers an in-depth analysis and demonstrates how 1http://www.nctb.gov.bd different topics prevail across weeks. Ahmed et al. (2021) presents a structured overview mod- eling research from 2003 to 2020, covering range of techniques. Its strength lies in highlight- ing the disparity between English and topic modeling efforts, answering some of the most im- portant questions regarding topic modeling such as "What are the techniques that have been used in En- glish topic modeling but not yet used in Bangla?", are the sources of the datasets used?" etc. through rigorous research. The study also effec- tively outlines future research scopes for Bengali topic modeling. But the review lacks quantitative analysis and remains mostly descriptive. Paul et al. (2025) compiled novel Bengali news dataset and proposed a hybrid model combining the potentials of both LDA and BERT, called BERT-LDA, ad- vancing topic modeling in Bengali. The study com- pares its proposed hybrid model with traditional models like LDA, LSI, Hierarchical Dirichlet Pro- cess (HDP) etc. in terms of topic coherence. The authors also applied their model on English bench- mark datasets (20NewsGroup, BBC) for mod- eling and demonstrated the results. Dawn et al. (2024) proposes a Dirichlet-polynomial cluster- ing model called Likelihood Corpus Distribution (LCD), which is based on a Bayesian numerical prototype that evaluates the probability distribution of words in a document to identify topics. Exper- iments are done to show the efficiency of LCD over conventional topic models on five real-world datasets of Bengali corpora. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been proven to be effective across many scientific tasks including NLP and have also caught the attention of the topic modeling community in recent years. Thus, many researchers in this field have success- fully incorporated GNN in topic modeling. Some topic modeling studies are discussed below. Shen al. (2021) proposed a novel method called Graph Neural Topic Model (GNTM), which represents documents as semantic graphs and uses the Neural Variational Inference (NVI) approach with GNN for topic modeling. They evaluated their model against baseline topic modeling methods on four benchmark English datasets and showed promise in performance. Graph Contrastive Neu- ral Topic Model (GCTM) (Luo et al., 2024) in- tegrates contrastive learning with topic modeling via graph-based sampling to resolve semantic re- dundancy and false negatives in topic discovery. Their model treats document data augmentation as --- Page 3 --- a graph data augmentation problem and conducts graph contrastive learning (GCL) based on instruc- tive positive and negative samples generated by a graph-based sampling strategy. GCTM signifi- cantly outperforms existing neural topic models in coherence and representation quality across mark datasets in English. Graph Enhanced Au- toencoded Variational Inference for Biterm Topic Model (GraphBTM) (Zhu al., 2018) represents bi-terms as graphs and design GCNs with resid- ual connections to extract transitive features from bi-terms, resulting in more coherent topics. They also propose a dataset called “All News” which has larger documents than 20 Newsgroups. Topic Mod- eling with Graph Isomorphism Network (GINopic) (Adhya and Sanyal, 2025) is another approach that takes the word similarity graphs for each document, where word similarity graph is constructed us- ing word embeddings to capture the complex corre- lations between the words. The study performs ex- trinsic evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, showing effectiveness of GINopic. While GNN-based models have shown their prominence in topic modeling, it has not been adapted for Bengali language yet, to the best of our knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose novel method using GCN, especially tailored for Bengali. 3 Methodology The proposed GHTM model consists of three stages. First, text features are extracted using combination of TF-IDF and GloVe representations. The second stage constructs a graph from the ex- tracted vectors, which is then processed by a graph convolutional network to produce similarity-aware embeddings. Finally, matrix factorization is ap- plied to the embeddings to generate diverse and coherent topic keywords. 3.1 Text Vectorization The text vectorization process based on the com- bination TF-IDF and GloVe. First, the TF-IDF vectorizer constructs a sparse document-term ma- trix of size N × V, where N is the number of doc- uments and V is the vocabulary size. Separately, the GloVe model generates a dense V × D trix of pre-trained word embeddings for the same vocabulary, where D denotes the embedding di- mension. The matrix dot product of the TF-IDF matrix and the GloVe embeddings produces the Figure 1: Text Vectorization Stage. TF-IDF produced sparse document-term matrix N × V and × D matrix generated by GloVe goes through matrix multiplication. It yields a document representa- tion N × D. final document representation × D. This effectively merges the statistical relevance of TF-IDF with the semantic richness of GloVe. As a result, the input vector becomes GloVe embeddings weighted by TF-IDF for each docu- ment, where each vector reflects the importance of its constituent words on their TF-IDF scores. 3.2 Network (GCN) GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) is a power- ful neural architecture is used in GHTM to learn the similarity of documents topic mod- eling. Since, GCN requires graph representation of input, a K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) is constructed from the previously calculated vectors. To construct this graph, we represent the docu- ments as graph nodes and connect these nodes with edges based on document similarity. As this is a KNN graph, the edges are connected depending on neighbors of each node and the distance is calcu- lated using cosine similarity. Therefore, we get a representation of our input which is similarity-aware. The GCN here acts as a influ- ential intermediary which learns the way to keep close similar nodes together and push the dissimilar nodes apart and reduces the dimensionality along the way. Cluster-GCN (Chiang al., 2019) used to utilize the GPU memory efficiently, dividing the input graph into sub-graphs. This way, the GPU does not run out of memory trying to process the whole graph at once, when the training data is sub- stantially large. The performance does not suffer because of Cluster-GCN as we preserve the inter- cluster edges. The architecture employs a joint loss function, combining margin-based hinge loss, enforcing local edge structure preservation through posi- tive/negative node pair contrast, with a global con- --- Page 4 --- Figure 2: Network (GCN) Stage. The N × D, converted to a KNN graph and passed through Cluster-GCN to get enriched similarity-aware document embeddings. Here, Do denotes the output dimension of the GCN. trastive loss that sharpens embedding distinctive- ness via self-supervised discrimination. To sim- ply put, hinge loss penalizes dissimilar connected nodes, and contrastive loss makes each nodes em- bedding unique, balancing local relational fidelity (via edges) and global semantic separation (via contrastive pull-push). architecture employs edge dropout and residual connections, enabling scalable processing of graph-structured data and stabilizes training via graph normalization. At the end of this stage, GCN produces refined, dimensionality reduced and semantically enriched embeddings which now can be to the next stage. 3.3 Matrix Factorization This is the final stage of GHTM, where Non- negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) applied to decompose the GCN produced embeddings for ex- tracting topics. Unlike traditional NMF-based topic modeling, which factorizes sparse document-term matrix, our approach factorizes a dense document embedding matrix. Since NMF requires non-negative inputs, sev- eral transformation techniques—such as ReLU, SoftPlus, Global Minimum Shift, and Absolute Value Transformation—are explored to ensure non- negativity. Among these, Absolute Value Transfor- mation yields the best performance in our case. Xnon-negative = |X| (1) where X is the input matrix. Following factorization, a document-topic dis- tribution matrix (W) is obtained, where each row corresponds to a document and each column re- flects the document’s association with a topic. Ad- ditionally, a topic-embedding matrix (H) is gener- ated; however, this matrix does not directly map Figure 3: Matrix Factorization Stage. Refined em- beddings from GCN stage are factorized using NMF to derive document-topic distribution matrix (W) and topic-embedding matrix (H). to words, as it captures abstract relationships in the embedding space rather than explicit vocabu- lary terms. Therefore, instead of directly retrieving topic words from the factorized matrices, a post- processing workaround is employed to map the learned topics to human-interpretable keywords, as described in the following steps. 1. From the document-topic matrix (W), we iden- tify the representative documents for each topic. 2. We aggregate the term frequencies from those documents using the original sparse matrix from the vectorization stage N × V. 3. Finally, we select the most frequent terms in these aggregated weights as the topic words. This bypasses the need to interpret the abstract embedding-based topic components, rather, this method assumes that documents strongly associ- ated with a topic will contain words relevant to that topic in their raw text data. 4 Results and Analysis This section elaborately discusses the datasets and evaluation metrics used in this study, experimental setup, comparative analysis results and the findings. This study benchmarks model against diverse topic-modeling approaches: tra- ditional methods like LDA et al., 2003) (probabilistic generative modeling), LSA et al., 1990) (linear algebra via Singular Value Decomposition), and NMF Seung, 1999) (non-negative matrix factorization); neural variants including (Srivastava and Sut- ton, 2017) (Variational Autoencoder with multino- mial decoding), al., 2018) (neural parameterization of Dirichlet priors), and ETM (Dieng et al., 2020) (topic-word embedding --- Page 5 --- alignment); embedding-enhanced models such as CombinedTM (Bianchi et al., 2021a) (BoW + SBERT inputs) and ZeroShotTM et al., 2021b) (SBERT-based zero-shot transfer); and clustering-driven frameworks Top2Vec gelov, 2020) (joint document-word embedding with UMAP/HDBSCAN) and BERTopic (Groo- tendorst, 2022) (BERT embeddings, UMAP, HDB- SCAN, and c-TF-IDF for data-driven topics). The comparison spans probabilistic, neural, embedding- integrated, and clustering-based paradigms to eval- uate cross-methodological performance. 4.1 Datasets This research utilizes three datasets of varying sizes to evaluate the proposed GHTM approach along- side existing topic modeling techniques. Jamuna News is curated from the Jamuna TV website. It is a balanced collection of short docu- ments, obtained from Kaggle2. BanFakeNews (Hossain al., 2020), is com- piled from Bengali newspaper. This dataset was released to combat the spread of fake news in Ben- gali. This study uses its "Authentic-48K" subset, sourced from Kaggle and stripped the labels for topic modeling purposes. NCTBText, a novel dataset developed for this research. It comprises unlabelled text from text- books available on the Bangladesh Government’s NCTB website. The dataset includes diverse sub- jects such as Religion, Bengali, Science, Agricul- ture, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Business, Social Science, and Home Sci- ence. The attributes the datasets are presented as a summary in Table 1. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics We evaluate the performance of the models terms of both topic diversity and coherence. The in study are introduced below. Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) (Newman et al., 2010) is statistical mea- sure of word association that measures topic co- herence internally using a sliding window to count word co-occurrence patterns. The measure ranges from [-1, 1] where 1 indicates a perfect relevance in a topic. 2https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ durjoychandrapaul/over-11500-bangla-news-for-nlp NPMI (wi, wj) = log P(wi,wj) P(wi)P(wj) −log P (wi, wj) (2) where P(wi) and P(wj) are marginal probabilities of the words wi and wj. P(wi, wj) is the joint probability of co-occurrence. Topic Coherence (CV) (Röder et al., 2015) is a variant of NPMI that measures the semantic relat- edness of topic words. It uses the one-set segmen- tation count word co-occurrences and the cosine similarity as the similarity measure. It ranges from [0, 1], where 1 means closely related words identi- fied as topic representatives. Topic Diversity (TD) al., 2020) mea- sures the uniqueness the words across all top- ics and the from [0, 1] where 0 indicates redundant topics and 1 indicates highly diverse topics. TD = SK k=1 Wk K × T (3) where Wk = Set of top T words in topic k, and K = Total number of topics. Inverted Rank-Biased Overlap (IRBO) (Web- ber et al., 2010), a diversity metric that evaluates inter-topic dissimilarity, derived from Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO). While RBO quantifies the similar- ity of ranked word lists across topics, IRBO inverts RBO to penalize overlapping top words. We used Gensim’s CoherenceModel ( ˇReh˚uˇrek and Sojka, 2010) to compute coherence metrics (NPMI and CV) and OCTIS (Optimizing and Com- paring Topic models is Simple) (Terragni et al., 2021) to calculate diversity metrics (TD and IRBO). Runtime (RT) is also recorded for each run to ob- serve how long models take to train, as the size of the dataset grows. Usually, modeling studies experiment with the topic number, k, but we set number of topics according to the ground truth to ensure uni- formity across the models. Except BERTopic and Top2vec, all the models that are being compared here expects the topic number to be set beforehand. Therefore, we add another metric in our compari- son table called, Topics Identified (n) to observe how many topics the models (BERTopic, Top2Vec) think are there in the dataset. 4.3 Experimental Setup This section outlines the experimental settings in this research, including data preparation and --- Page 6 --- Dataset Count of Documents Vocabulary Size Classes Size Avg.

While and Top2Vec accepts raw sen- tences as they work with sentence-level embed- dings, other conventional neural models ac- cept tokenized list of words as documents. Com- binedTM and ZeroShotTM, on the other hand lever- ages both formats. The tokenized format the datasets went through rigorous pre-processing steps like tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatiza- tion, while raw sentence format only had unnec- essary punctuations and numerics removed. We used unigrams across the models for this study to keep the comparison straightforward. 4.3.2 Model Configuration All the models employed in the study were set to their default configurations and hyper-parameters, but we had to modify sklearns CountVectorizer parameters for models that uses this module for vectorization to accurately handle Bengali text tokenization. The hyper-parameter values used in GHTM, the other hand, are shown in Table 3 for each dataset. The embedding that are used throughout the experiment are summarized in Table 2. 4.4 Findings This section discusses and analyzes the results of the experiment that is in Table 4.

This metric is only applica- ble for BERTopic and Top2Vec. Considering the neural models, ETM has the inferior results than the others, despite using Fast- Text for word embeddings, while CombinedTM performs well leveraging both BoW and sentence transformer embeddings, which also thrives in gen- erating diverse topics. Among the cluster-based models, Top2Vec based on Doc2Vec embeddings is way ahead than others. Despite performing well on Doc2Vec, while tried on other available embedding options for Bengali such as universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual, distiluse-base-multilingual-cased and paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2, Top2Vec fails by only producing 1 topic. We also learn from Table 4 that, the dataset grows, the runtime for Top2Vec increases rapidly. BERTopic other hand takes a reasonable amount of time based on dataset size, but its performance lags behind Top2Vec. As BERTopic offers modularity and flexibility in choosing embedding model, dimensionality reduction model and clustering model, it gave us the chance to explore a lot of combinations for Bengali. And our experiments show that Bengali sentence transformer model along with UMAP and KMeans works best for Bengali in BERTopic, rather than the authentic BERTopic combination of UMAP and HDBSCAN. --- Page 7 --- Model NCTBText BanFakeNews CV NP MI TD IR BO RT n RT n Traditional Models LDA (BOW) 0.62 0.08 0.89 0.95 3 - 0.50 0.03 0.83 3 - 0.64 0.12 0.86 0.97 33 10 LDA (TF-IDF) 0.57 0.03 0.91 3 - 0.51 -0.04 0.96 0.99 3 - 0.65 0.09 0.97 1.00 30 10 LSA (BOW) 0.51 -0.04 0.60 0.63 1 - 0.34 -0.05 0.47 0.78 1 - 0.44 -0.01 0.39 0.79 12 - LSA (TF-IDF) 0.49 -0.05 0.68 0.67 1 - 0.42 -0.07 0.61 0.78 2 - 0.45 -0.03 0.42 0.83 21 - NMF (BOW) 0.62 0.09 0.91 0.95 1 - 0.54 0.06 0.82 0.96 1 - 0.67 0.13 0.84 0.97 8 10 NMF (TF-IDF) 0.65 0.08 0.98 0.99 1 - 0.57 0.04 0.95 1 - 0.72 0.17 0.94 0.99 16 10 Neural Models ProdLDA 0.60 -0.02 1.00 1.[PHONE].66 0.05 1.00 1.[PHONE].39 -0.19 0.89 0.98 2355 - Neural LDA 0.55 -0.24 1.00 1.[PHONE].54 -0.30 1.00 1.[PHONE].42 -0.22 0.96 0.99 2187 - ETM (FastText) 0.49 -0.02 0.92 0.95 14 - 0.40 -0.14 0.81 0.94 21 - 0.49 -0.12 0.08 0.00 411 - Combined TM 0.67 0.04 1.00 1.[PHONE].64 0.05 1.00 1.[PHONE].71 0.14 1.00 1.00 686 - ZeroShot TM 0.66 0.04 0.87 0.[PHONE].64 0.05 1.00 1.[PHONE].60 0.05 0.37 0.75 353 - Cluster-Based Models Top2vec 0.83 0.18 1.00 1.[PHONE].74 0.11 1.00 1.[PHONE].80 0.12 0.99 1.[PHONE] BERTopic (W2V+UMAP+HDBSCAN) 0.26 -0.15 0.78 0.81 35 3 0.44 -0.05 0.73 0.90 34 9 0.39 -0.12 0.85 0.95 176 6 BERTopic (GloVe+UMAP+HDBSCAN) 0.53 0.03 0.83 0.[PHONE].56 0.13 0.68 0.[PHONE].43 -0.11 0.83 0.95 278 7 BERTopic (Doc2Vec+UMAP+HDBSCAN) 0.25 -0.16 0.67 0.72 36 4 0.44 -0.05 0.72 0.[PHONE].36 -0.12 0.84 0.94 157 6 BERTopic (FastText+UMAP+HDBSCAN) 0.25 -0.18 0.77 0.80 47 3 0.42 -0.07 0.79 0.[PHONE].40 -0.12 0.86 0.96 167 6 BERTopic (ST+UMAP+HDBSCAN) 0.48 -0.06 0.85 0.[PHONE].82 -0.08 0.44 0.52 56 6 0.62 0.03 0.93 0.[PHONE] BERTopic (ST+PCA+HDBSCAN) 0.55 -0.03 0.99 1.00 82 4 0.78 -0.05 0.49 0.61 53 6 0.62 0.00 0.93 0.99 239 10 BERTopic (ST+SVD+HDBSCAN) 0.66 0.01 1.00 1.00 82 5 0.78 -0.04 0.51 0.62 53 6 0.56 0.03 1.00 1.00 285 3 BERTopic (ST+HDBSCAN) 0.65 0.02 82 4 0.77 -0.04 0.55 0.74 52 7 0.53 0.02 0.97 0.99 282 3 BERTopic (ST+UMAP+KMeans) 0.71 0.08 82 4 0.69 0.97 0.99 54 8 0.67 0.07 0.94 0.99 307 12 BERTopic (ST+UMAP+Agglomerative) 0.54 -0.09 0.93 0.96 81 4 0.58 -0.09 0.86 0.96 53 8 0.65 0.00 0.97 0.99 232 12 BERTopic (ST+UMAP+DBSCAN) 0.43 -0.12 0.91 0.92 82 4 0.65 -0.09 0.76 0.86 52 4 0.59 0.01 0.94 0.99 233 43 BERTopic (ST+UMAP+Spectral) 0.56 0.02 0.93 0.97 72 6 0.66 0.01 0.93 0.[PHONE].66 0.07 0.92 0.[PHONE] GHTM (Proposed) 0.91 0.31 1.00 1.00 23 - 0.87 0.27 0.99 1.00 15 - 0.82 0.28 0.96 0.99 230 - Table 4: Comprehensive model comparison across the datasets.

It also doesn’t require much runtime, even when the dataset size grows. The overall results verify GHTM’s efficacy over Bengali text data. The topics generated by GHTM along with the original categories is demonstrated in Table 5 for the dataset NCTBText. Bigrams for performance boost: While gen- erating the vocabulary, if we consider bi-grams along with unigrams, performance of GHTM increases in every aspect. However, bi-grams were not employed this study, to ensure uniformity in experimental setup the models. Cluster Size for Cluster-GCN: Too many clus- ters fragment the graph, degrading model perfor- mance, whereas too few clusters cause memory is- sues. Thus, while setting the ‘num_clusters’ param- eter for Cluster-GCN, we’ve to maintain a balance depending on the dataset size, number of hidden layers, memory size etc. In our case, this parameter set to k (the number of topics) after empirical testing showed it yielded the best model perfor- mance.

This study verifies that, we can use topic models for generating coherent and latent themes from Bengali corpus. The topics extracted can be used to initially sense of an unlabeled text dataset and further utilized for data annotation, which can contribute a lot in NLP tasks, especially for low-resource languages. Leveraging GCN and NMF, we have developed a hybrid model- ing approach called GHTM, which significantly Figure 6: Visualization of by GHTM for the NCTBText dataset, distributed across original categories to demonstrate topic quality. improves performance coherence and di- versity for Bengali dataset compared to existing models. The model shows promise and can be fur- ther advanced in the future for even better results and adapted for any language. Limitations This paper assumes topic numbers as a constant based on ground truth rather than a hyperparam- eter to be tuned. This approach forces models to generalize the topics to align with the authentic cat- egories, because we intended find out which mod- els can do it best. We strongly believe that topic models can act as a great starter for annotating unla- beled documents low-resource languages. How- ever, setting topic number beforehand while not knowing the exact categories of an unstructured or unlabeled dataset, can be count as a limitation. --- Page 9 --- We hope to experiment further in future on how clustering works on GCN refined embeddings, so that we don’t have to rely on topic numbers and let the model identify the latent topics by itself. More- over, GHTM, being a neural network-based model, intensively uses GPU for the Cluster-GCN part and the runtime can become slower if ran on CPU only.

The second feature is that it has natural language processor.
This essentially means that it is designed to understand and process human like language.
The good news is, you can talk to it just like a regular human.
You can use natural language, you don't have to think about too hard,
about do I need to use specific technical words.
Now there are best practices on how to properly create effective prompts,
and we'll talk about that, but you can talk to it like a human.
Now, the third thing is, is that it generates text.
That's what the chat refers to.
So it's going to generate text, coherent text, relevant text,
based off of the prompts that you provide.
Now, what are some of the applications for chat GPT?
One thing I'll say is, how you use it versus how I use it,
versus how my colleagues use it,
it's going to be very different.
Neurolinguistic programming, or NLP, has evolved as a powerful communication tool across major academic institutions.
Stanford Graduate School of Business emphasizes the use of NLP for personal impact,
teaching how language patterns can influence perception.
Harvard University focuses on the emotional and psychological aspects,
enhancing audience engagement and empathy.
Oxford University explores the kinetics of body language within NLP, emphasizing nonverbal cues.
At Massachusetts Institute of Technology, data-driven NLP techniques integrate AI to enhance communication efficiency.
Yale University and UC Berkeley highlight cultural adaptability using NLP to bridge diverse backgrounds.
This multidisciplinary approach underlines NLP's versatility in reshaping communication strategies.
Hello, my name is Robbie Steinhouse and I'm introducing myself as part of the training team at the NLP
University trainer training taking place in Crete between the 14th and 29th of September. My speciality is teaching
things around specific presentation skills using spatial anchors. So I'm using my hand here,
I'm using my hand there. So it's that sort of thing, maybe facial expressions, looking at different ways, different gestures.
How can you do this in such a way to bring influence and make a difference? I'm really excited to meet you. Thank you very much.
Two main purposes that I want you guys to think about when it comes to data analytics in the military.
Number one is you can see readiness, number two is decreased spending.
You can't do both at the same time, this is one of the other.
This is an attempt to do both.
So this past summer I went into an internship over at Community Air Force
just working in this analytics group.
Data analytics for the Airbus.
The Airbus is in charge of all the aircraft in the Navy.
And so anything you want you can get...
